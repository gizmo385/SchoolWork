Doc171     right glad i am he was not at this fray
Doc172   ben madam an hour before the worshippd sun
Doc173     peerd forth the golden window of the east
Doc174     a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
Doc175     where underneath the grove of sycamore
Doc176     that westward rooteth from the citys side
Doc177     so early walking did i see your son
Doc178     towards him i made but he was ware of me
Doc179     and stole into the covert of the wood
Doc180     i  measuring his affections by my own
Doc181     which then most sought where most might not be found
Doc182     being one too many by my weary self 
Doc183     pursud my humour not pursuing his
Doc184     and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me
Doc185   mon many a morning hath he there been seen
Doc186     with tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew
Doc187     adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
Doc188     but all so soon as the all cheering sun
Doc189     should in the furthest east bean to draw
Doc190     the shady curtains from auroras bed
Doc191     away from light steals home my heavy son
Doc192     and private in his chamber pens himself
Doc193     shuts up his windows locks fair daylight
Doc194     and makes himself an artificial night
Doc195     black and portentous must this humour prove
Doc196     unless good counsel may the cause remove
Doc197   ben my noble uncle do you know the cause?
Doc198   mon i neither know it nor can learn of him
Doc199   ben have you importund him by any means?

Doc202     is to himself  i will not say how true 
Doc203     but to himself so secret and so close
Doc204     so far from sounding and discovery
Doc205     as is the bud bit with an envious worm
Doc206     ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
Doc207     or dedicate his beauty to the sun
Doc208     could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
Doc209     we would as willingly give cure as know
Doc210                        enter romeo

Doc586   mer o then i see queen mab hath been with you
Doc587     she is the fairies midwife and she comes
Doc588     in shape no bigger than an agate stone
Doc589     on the forefinger of an alderman
Doc590     drawn with a team of little atomies
Doc591     athwart mens noses as they lie asleep
Doc592     her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs
Doc593     the cover of the wings of grasshoppers
Doc594     her traces of the smallest spiders web
Doc595     her collars of the moonshines watry beams
Doc596     her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
Doc597     her wagoner a small grey coated gnat
Doc598     not half so big as a round little worm
Doc599     prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
Doc600     her chariot is an empty hazelnut
Doc601     made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
Doc602     time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
Doc603     and in this state she gallops night by night
Doc604     through lovers brains and then they dream of love
Doc605     oer courtiers knees that dream on cursies straight
Doc606     oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
Doc607     oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream
Doc608     which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues
Doc609     because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
Doc610     sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
Doc611     and then dreams he of smelling out a suit
Doc612     and sometime comes she with a tithe pigs tail
Doc613     tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
Doc614     then dreams he of another benefice
Doc615     sometimes she driveth oer a soldiers neck
Doc616     and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
Doc617     of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades
Doc618     of healths five fadom deep and then anon
Doc619     drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
Doc620     and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
Doc621     and sleeps again this is that very mab
Doc622     that plats the manes of horses in the night
Doc623     and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
Doc624     which once untangled much misfortune bodes
Doc625     this is the hag when maids lie on their backs
Doc626     that presses them and learns them first to bear
Doc627     making them women of good carriage
Doc628     this is she 
Doc629   rom peace peace mercutio peace
Doc630     thou talkst of nothing
Doc631   mer true i talk of dreams
Doc632     which are the children of an idle brain
Doc633     begot of nothing but vain fantasy
Doc634     which is as thin of substance as the air
Doc635     and more inconstant than the wind who wooes
Doc636     even now the frozen bosom of the north
Doc637     and being angerd puffs away from thence
Doc638     turning his face to the dew dropping south
Doc639   ben this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
Doc640     supper is done and we shall come too late
Doc641   rom i fear too early for my mind misgives
Doc642     some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Doc643     shall bitterly begin his fearful date
Doc644     with this nights revels and expire the term
Doc645     of a despised life closd in my breast
Doc646     by some vile forfeit of untimely death

Doc1690     could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Doc1691     of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
Doc1692     with piercing steel at bold mercutios breast
Doc1693     who all as hot turns deadly point to point
Doc1694     and with a martial scorn with one hand beats
Doc1695     cold death aside and with the other sends
Doc1696     it back to tybalt whose dexterity
Doc1697     retorts it romeo he cries aloud
Doc1698     hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue
Doc1699     his agile arm beats down their fatal points

Doc1701     an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
Doc1702     of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled

Doc2452     if rather than to marry county paris
Doc2453     thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
Doc2454     then is it likely thou wilt undertake
Doc2455     a thing like death to chide away this shame

Doc2463     oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
Doc2464     with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
Doc2465     or bid me go into a new made grave

Doc2476     when presently through all thy veins shall run
Doc2477     a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
Doc2478     shall keep his native progress but surcease
Doc2479     no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
Doc2480     the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
Doc2481     to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
Doc2482     like death when he shuts up the day of life
Doc2483     each part deprivd of supple government
Doc2484     shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
Doc2485     and in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death

Doc3265     and here he writes that he did buy a poison
Doc3266     of a poor pothecary and therewithal
Doc3267     came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
Doc3268     where be these enemies? capulet montage
Doc3269     see what a scourge is laid upon your hate
Doc3270     that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
Doc3271     and i for winking at you discords too
Doc3272     have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd
Doc3273   cap o brother montague give me thy hand
Doc3274     this is my daughters jointure for no more
Doc3275     can i demand
Doc3276   mon but i can give thee more
Doc3277     for i will raise her statue in pure gold
Doc3278     that whiles verona by that name is known
Doc3279     there shall no figure at such rate be set
Doc3280     as that of true and faithful juliet
Doc3281   cap as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie 
Doc3282     poor sacrifices of our enmity
Doc3283   prince a glooming peace this morning with it brings
Doc3284     the sun for sorrow will not show his head
Doc3285     go hence to have more talk of these sad things
Doc3286     some shall be pardond and some punished
Doc3287     for never was a story of more woe
Doc3288     than this of juliet and her romeo
Doc3289                                                    exeunt omnes
Doc3290 the end
