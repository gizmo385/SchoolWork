Why Study Finite Automata?

* String matching and searching
    - Regular expressions are closely related to finite automata

* Lexical Analysis in Compilers

* Software Verification

* Communication Protocols



Why Study Context Free Grammars:

* Conventions:
    - Capital letters for non-terminals; e.g. E, T, F
    - Lower case letters and symbols for terminals; e.g., id, +, *
    - Group productions for the same nonterminal; e.g.,
      write:
        E -> E + T | T

      for:
        E -> E + T
        E -> T


Intractible and Undecidable Problems

* Intractible Problems:
    - The Traveling Salesman Problem
    - Combinatorial Testing
