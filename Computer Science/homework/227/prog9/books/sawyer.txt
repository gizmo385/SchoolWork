Title:                                     Preface
Title:  
Title:     MOST of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two
Title:  were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of
Title:  mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an
Title:  individual -- he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom
Title:  I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.
Title:  
Title:     The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and
Title:  slaves in the West at the period of this story -- that is to say, thirty or
Title:  forty years ago.
Title:  
Title:     Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and
Title:  girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account, for
Title:  
Title:  part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they
Title:  once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked, and what
Title:  queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.

Title:                                    Chapter I
Title:  
Title:     "TOM!"
Title:  
Title:     No answer.
Title:  
Title:      "TOM!"
Title:  
Title:     No answer.
Title:  
Title:     "What's gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!"
Title:  
Title:     No answer.
Title:  
Title:     The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the
Title:  room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never
Title:  looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair,
Title:  the pride of her heart, and were built for "style," not service -- she could
Title:  have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed
Title:  for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the
Title:  furniture to hear:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll -- "
Title:  
Title:     She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching
Title:  under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the
Title:  punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.
Title:  
Title:     "I never did see the beat of that boy!"
Title:  
Title:     She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato
Title:  vines and "jimpson" weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So she lifted
Title:  up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:
Title:  
Title:     "Y-o-u-u Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize
Title:  a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.
Title:  
Title:     "There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in
Title:  there?"
Title:  
Title:     "Nothing."
Title:  
Title:     "Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What is that
Title:  truck?"
Title:  
Title:      "I don't know, aunt."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I know. It's jam -- that's what it is. Forty times I've said if
Title:  you didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch."
Title:  
Title:     The switch hovered in the air -- the peril was desperate --
Title:  
Title:     "My! Look behind you, aunt!"
Title:  
Title:     The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. The
Title:  lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and disappeared
Title:  over it.
Title:  
Title:     His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
Title:  laugh.
Title:  
Title:     "Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks
Title:  enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old
Title:  fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks, as the
Title:  saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is
Title:  a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long he can torment
Title:  me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off
Title:  for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and I can't hit him a
Title:  lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's the Lord's truth,
Title:  goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says.
Title:  I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know. He's full of the Old
Title:  Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my own dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I
Title:  ain't got the heart to lash him, somehow. Every time I let him off, my
Title:  conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most
Title:  breaks. Well-a-well, man that is born of woman is of few days and full of
Title:  trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this
Title:  evening, * and [* Southwestern for "afternoon"] I'll just be obleeged to
Title:  make him work, to-morrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work
Title:  Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than
Title:  he hates anything else, and I've got to do some of my duty by him, or I'll
Title:  be the ruination of the child."
Title:  
Title:     Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home barely
Title:  in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's wood
Title:  and split the kindlings before supper -- at least he was there in time to
Title:  tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work. Tom's
Title:  younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through with his
Title:  part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no
Title:  adventurous, troublesome ways.
Title:  
Title:     While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
Title:  offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and very
Title:  deep -- for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like many
Title:  other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed
Title:  with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to
Title:  contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. Said
Title:  she:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes'm."
Title:  
Title:     "Powerful warm, warn't it?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes'm."
Title:  
Title:     "Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     A bit of a scare shot through Tom -- a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.
Title:  He searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said:
Title:  
Title:     "No'm -- well, not very much."
Title:  
Title:     The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said:
Title:  
Title:     "But you ain't too warm now, though." And it flattered her to reflect
Title:  that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that
Title:  that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew where
Title:  the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:
Title:  
Title:     "Some of us pumped on our heads -- mine's damp yet. See?"
Title:  
Title:     Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
Title:  circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new inspiration:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump
Title:  on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!"
Title:  
Title:     The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt
Title:  collar was securely sewed.
Title:  
Title:     "Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey and
Title:  been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a singed
Title:  cat, as the saying is -- better'n you look. This time."
Title:  
Title:     She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom
Title:  had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.
Title:  
Title:     But Sidney said:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread, but
Title:  it's black."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Siddy, I'll lick you for that."
Title:  
Title:     In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the
Title:  lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them -- one needle carried
Title:  white thread and the other black. He said:
Title:  
Title:     "She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes
Title:  she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to
Title:  geeminy she'd stick to one or t'other -- I can't keep the run of 'em. But I
Title:  bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!"
Title:  
Title:     He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well
Title:  though -- and loathed him.
Title:  
Title:     Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not
Title:  because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man's
Title:  are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and
Title:  drove them out of his mind for the time -- just as men's misfortunes are
Title:  forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a
Title:  valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and he
Title:  was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It consisted in a peculiar
Title:  bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to
Title:  the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music -- the
Title:  reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence
Title:  and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street
Title:  with his mouth full of harmony
Title:  and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer feels who has
Title:  discovered a new planet -- no doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed
Title:  pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the astronomer.
Title:  
Title:     The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom
Title:  checked his whistle. A stranger was before him -- a boy a shade larger than
Title:  himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity in
Title:  the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy was well dressed,
Title:  too -- well dressed on a week-day. This was simply astounding. His cap was a
Title:  dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty,
Title:  and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes on -- and it was only Friday. He
Title:  even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon. He had a citified air about him
Title:  that ate into Tom's vitals. The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the
Title:  higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his
Title:  own outfit seemed to him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other
Title:  moved -- but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to
Title:  eye all the time. Finally Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "I can lick you!"
Title:  
Title:     "I'd like to see you try it."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I can do it."
Title:  
Title:     "No you can't, either."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes I can."
Title:  
Title:     "No you can't."
Title:  
Title:     "I can."
Title:  
Title:     "You can't."
Title:  
Title:     "Can!"
Title:  
Title:     "Can't!"
Title:  
Title:     An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "What's your name?"
Title:  
Title:     "'Tisn't any of your business, maybe."
Title:  
Title:     "Well I 'low I'll make it my business."
Title:  
Title:     "Well why don't you?"
Title:  
Title:     "If you say much, I will."
Title:  
Title:     "Much -- much -- much. There now."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, you think you're mighty smart, don't you? I could lick you with one
Title:  hand tied behind me, if I wanted to."
Title:  
Title:     "Well why don't you do it? You say you can do it."
Title:  
Title:     "Well I will , if you fool with me."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh yes -- I've seen whole families in the same fix."
Title:  
Title:     "Smarty! You think you're some , now, don't you? Oh, what a hat!"
Title:  
Title:     "You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it off
Title:  -- and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs."
Title:  
Title:     "You're a liar!"
Title:  
Title:     "You're another."
Title:  
Title:     "You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up."
Title:  
Title:     "Aw -- take a walk!"
Title:  
Title:     "Say -- if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock
Title:  off'n your head."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, of course you will."
Title:  
Title:     "Well I will ."
Title:  
Title:     "Well why don't you do it then? What do you keep saying you will for? Why
Title:  don't you do it? It's because you're afraid."
Title:  
Title:     "I ain't afraid."
Title:  
Title:     "You are."
Title:  
Title:     "I ain't."
Title:  
Title:     "You are."
Title:  
Title:     Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently
Title:  they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Get away from here!"
Title:  
Title:     "Go away yourself!"
Title:  
Title:     "I won't."
Title:  
Title:     "I won't either."
Title:  
Title:     So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both
Title:  shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But
Title:  neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and
Title:  flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and he can
Title:  thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too."
Title:  
Title:     "What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's bigger
Title:  than he is -- and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too." [Both
Title:  brothers were imaginary.]
Title:  
Title:     "That's a lie."
Title:  
Title:     "Your saying so don't make it so."
Title:  
Title:     Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:
Title:  
Title:     "I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand up.
Title:  Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep."
Title:  
Title:     The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it."
Title:  
Title:     "Don't you crowd me now; you better look out."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, you said you'd do it -- why don't you do it?"
Title:  
Title:     "By jingo! for two cents I will do it."
Title:  
Title:     The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
Title:  with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys were
Title:  rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the
Title:  space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes,
Title:  punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves with dust
Title:  and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle
Title:  Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists.
Title:  "Holler 'nuff!" said he.
Title:  
Title:     The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying -- mainly from
Title:  rage.
Title:  
Title:     "Holler 'nuff!" -- and the pounding went on.
Title:  
Title:     At last the stranger got out a smothered "'Nuff!" and Tom let him up and
Title:  said: "Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next
Title:  time."
Title:  
Title:     The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
Title:  snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
Title:  threatening what he would do to Tom the "next time he caught him out." To
Title:  which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon
Title:  as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him
Title:  between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope. Tom
Title:  chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived. He then held a
Title:  position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but
Title:  the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined. At last
Title:  the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child,
Title:  and ordered him away. So he went away; but he said he "'lowed" to "lay" for
Title:  that boy.
Title:  
Title:     He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in at
Title:  the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when
Title:  she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday
Title:  holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.
Title:

Title:  
Title:                                   Chapter II
Title:  
Title:     SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh,
Title:  and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if the heart
Title:  was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in every face and a
Title:  spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of
Title:  the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it,
Title:  was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a
Title:  Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.
Title:  
Title:     Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
Title:  long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a
Title:  deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence
Title:  nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden.
Title:  Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated
Title:  the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak
Title:  with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a
Title:  tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with
Title:  a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had
Title:  always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but now it did not strike
Title:  him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto,
Title:  and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting,
Title:  trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered
Title:  that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got
Title:  back with a bucket of water under an hour -- and even then somebody
Title:  generally had to go after him. Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some."
Title:  
Title:     Jim shook his head and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water
Title:  an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec' Mars Tom gwine to
Title:  ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend to my own business
Title:  -- she 'lowed she'd 'tend to de whitewashin'."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she always talks.
Title:  Gimme the bucket -- I won't be gone only a a minute. She won't ever know."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n me.
Title:  'Deed she would."
Title:  
Title:     " She! She never licks anybody -- whacks 'em over the head with her
Title:  thimble -- and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks awful, but
Title:  don't hurt -- anyways it don't if she don't cry. Jim, I'll give you a marvel.
Title:  I'll give you a white alley!"
Title:  
Title:     Jim began to waver.
Title:  
Title:     "White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw."
Title:  
Title:     "My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's powerful
Title:  'fraid ole missis -- "
Title:  
Title:     "And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe."
Title:  
Title:     Jim was only human -- this attraction was too much for him. He put down
Title:  his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
Title:  interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was
Title:  flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was
Title:  whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a
Title:  slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye. But Tom's energy did not last.
Title:  He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his sorrows
Title:  multiplied. Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of
Title:  delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having
Title:  to work -- the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his
Title:  worldly wealth and examined it -- bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough
Title:  to buy an exchange of work, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as
Title:  half an hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his
Title:  pocket, and gave up the idea of trying
Title:  to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon
Title:  him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent inspiration.
Title:  
Title:     He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in
Title:  sight presently -- the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been
Title:  dreading. Ben's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump -- proof enough that his
Title:  heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and
Title:  giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
Title:  ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he
Title:  drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far
Title:  over to star-board and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and
Title:  circumstance -- for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered
Title:  himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and
Title:  engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own
Title:  hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:
Title:  
Title:     "Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!" The headway ran almost out, and he
Title:  drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.
Title:  
Title:     "Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!" His arms straightened and stiffened
Title:  down his sides.
Title:  
Title:     "Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!
Title:  Chow!" His right hand, meantime, describing stately circles -- for it was
Title:  representing a forty-foot wheel.
Title:  
Title:     "Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!"
Title:  The left hand began to describe circles.
Title:  
Title:     "Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on
Title:  the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling!
Title:  Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! Lively now! Come -- out with your
Title:  spring-line -- what're you about there! Take a turn round that stump with
Title:  the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now -- let her go! Done with the
Title:  engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! Sh't! s'h't! sh't!" (trying the
Title:  gauge-cocks).
Title:  
Title:     Tom went on whitewashing -- paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben
Title:  stared a moment and then said: "Hi- yi ! You're up a stump, ain't you!"
Title:  
Title:     No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he
Title:  gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben
Title:  ranged up alongside of him. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck
Title:  to his work. Ben said:
Title:  
Title:     "Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?"
Title:  
Title:     Tom wheeled suddenly and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing."
Title:  
Title:     "Say -- I'm going in a-swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of
Title:  course you'd druther work -- wouldn't you? Course you would!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:
Title:  
Title:     "What do you call work?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, ain't that work?"
Title:  
Title:     Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits Tom
Title:  Sawyer."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you like it?"
Title:  
Title:     The brush continued to move.
Title:  
Title:     "Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a
Title:  chance to whitewash a fence every day?"
Title:  
Title:     That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom
Title:  swept his brush daintily back and forth -- stepped back to note the effect
Title:  -- added a touch here and there -- criticised the effect again -- Ben
Title:  watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
Title:  absorbed. Presently he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little."
Title:  
Title:     Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:
Title:  
Title:     "No -- no -- I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's
Title:  awful particular about this fence -- right here on the street, you know --
Title:  but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and she wouldn't. Yes, she's
Title:  awful particular about this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I
Title:  reckon there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it
Title:  the way it's got to be done."
Title:  
Title:     "No -- is that so? Oh come, now -- lemme
Title:  just try. Only just a little -- I'd let you, if you was me, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly -- well, Jim wanted to do
Title:  it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't let Sid.
Title:  Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this fence and
Title:  anything was to happen to it -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say -- I'll give you
Title:  the core of my apple."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, here -- No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard -- "
Title:  
Title:     "I'll give you all of it!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his
Title:  heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the
Title:  sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his
Title:  legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There
Title:  was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while; they came
Title:  to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had
Title:  traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when
Title:  he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing
Title:  it with -- and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the
Title:  afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom
Title:  was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned,
Title:  twelve marbles,
Title:  part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool
Title:  cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass
Title:  stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six
Title:  fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a dog-collar
Title:  -- but no dog -- the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a
Title:  dilapidated old window sash.
Title:  
Title:     He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while -- plenty of company --
Title:  and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn't run out of
Title:  whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.
Title:  
Title:     Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He
Title:  had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it -- namely,
Title:  that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to
Title:  make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise
Title:  philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended
Title:  that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that Play
Title:  consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would help him to
Title:  understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill
Title:  is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement.
Title:  There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse
Title:  passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer,
Title:  because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were
Title:  offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they
Title:  would resign.
Title:  
Title:     The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in
Title:  his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to report.

Title:                                   Chapter III
Title:  
Title:     TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open
Title:  window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast-room,
Title:  dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer air, the restful quiet,
Title:  the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their
Title:  effect, and she was nodding over her knitting -- for she had no company but
Title:  the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her
Title:  gray head for safety. She had thought that of course Tom had deserted long
Title:  ago, and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this
Title:  intrepid way. He said: "Mayn't I go and play now, aunt?"
Title:  
Title:     "What, a'ready? How much have you done?"
Title:  
Title:     "It's all done, aunt."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, don't lie to me -- I can't bear it."
Title:  
Title:     "I ain't, aunt; it is all done."
Title:  
Title:     Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for
Title:  herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of Tom's
Title:  statement true. When she found the entire fence whitewashed, and not only
Title:  white-washed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added
Title:  to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She said:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when you're a
Title:  mind to, Tom." And then she diluted the compliment by adding, "But it's
Title:  powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to say. Well, go 'long and play;
Title:  but mind you get back some time in a week, or I'll tan you."
Title:  
Title:     She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him
Title:  into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him, along
Title:  with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to
Title:  itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort. And while she
Title:  closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he "hooked" a doughnut.
Title:  
Title:     Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway
Title:  that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and the air
Title:  was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a hail-storm;
Title:  and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the
Title:  rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the
Title:  fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded
Title:  for time to make use of it. His soul was at peace, now that he had settled
Title:  with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into
Title:  trouble.
Title:  
Title:     Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the
Title:  back of his aunt's cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach of
Title:  capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the
Title:  village, where two "military" companies of boys had met for conflict,
Title:  according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies,
Title:  Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two great commanders
Title:  did not condescend to fight in person -- that being better suited to the
Title:  still smaller fry -- but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field
Title:  operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. Tom's army won a great
Title:  victory, after a long and hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted,
Title:  prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the
Title:  day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into
Title:  line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.
Title:  
Title:     As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new
Title:  girl in the garden -- a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair
Title:  plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes.
Title:  The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence
Title:  vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind. He
Title:  had thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as
Title:  adoration; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. He
Title:  had been months winning her; she
Title:  had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest
Title:  boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time she
Title:  had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done.
Title:  
Title:     He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had
Title:  discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began
Title:  to "show off" in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win her
Title:  admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but
Title:  by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic
Title:  performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her
Title:  way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving,
Title:  and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a moment on the
Title:  steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her
Title:  foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a
Title:  pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.
Title:  
Title:     The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and
Title:  then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he
Title:  had discovered something of interest going on in that direction. Presently
Title:  he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his
Title:  head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he
Title:  edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon
Title:  it, his pliant
Title:  toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared
Title:  round the corner. But only for a minute -- only while he could button the
Title:  flower inside his jacket, next his heart -- or next his stomach, possibly,
Title:  for he was not much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.
Title:  
Title:     He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, "showing off,"
Title:  as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom comforted
Title:  himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window, meantime,
Title:  and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode home reluctantly, with
Title:  his poor head full of visions.
Title:  
Title:     All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered "what
Title:  had got into the child." He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and did
Title:  not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his aunt's
Title:  very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:
Title:  
Title:     "Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always into that
Title:  sugar if I warn't watching you."
Title:  
Title:     Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,
Title:  reached for the sugar-bowl -- a sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh
Title:  unbearable. But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. Tom
Title:  was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and
Title:  was silent. He said to himself that he would
Title:  not speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still
Title:  till she asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would
Title:  be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model "catch it." He was
Title:  so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady
Title:  came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from
Title:  over her spectacles. He said to himself, "Now it's coming!" And the next
Title:  instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted to
Title:  strike again when Tom cried out:
Title:  
Title:     "Hold on, now, what 'er you belting me for? -- Sid broke it!"
Title:  
Title:     Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when
Title:  she got her tongue again, she only said:
Title:  
Title:     "Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some
Title:  other audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like enough."
Title:  
Title:     Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind
Title:  and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession
Title:  that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. So she kept
Title:  silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a
Title:  corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her
Title:  knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He
Title:  would hang out no signals, he would take notice
Title:  of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through
Title:  a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself lying
Title:  sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little
Title:  forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that
Title:  word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought
Title:  home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at
Title:  rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall
Title:  like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would
Title:  never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and
Title:  make no sign -- a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He so
Title:  worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to
Title:  keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of
Title:  water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the
Title:  end of his nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows,
Title:  that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight
Title:  intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when
Title:  his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after
Title:  an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds
Title:  and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the
Title:  other.
Title:  
Title:     He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of
Title:  boys, and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log
Title:  raft in the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and
Title:  contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he
Title:  could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the
Title:  uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower. He
Title:  got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal
Title:  felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she cry, and
Title:  wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him?
Title:  Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world? This picture
Title:  brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and
Title:  over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till he wore
Title:  it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness.
Title:  
Title:     About half-past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to
Title:  where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon his
Title:  listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a
Title:  second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the fence,
Title:  threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under that
Title:  window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him down on
Title:  the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his hands clasped
Title:  upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower. And thus he would
Title:  die -- out in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless head, no
Title:  friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow, no loving face to bend
Title:  pityingly over him when the great agony came. And thus she would see him
Title:  when she looked out upon the glad morning, and oh! would she drop one little
Title:  tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see a
Title:  bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut down?
Title:  
Title:     The window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned the holy
Title:  calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains!
Title:  
Title:     The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz as
Title:  of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound as of
Title:  shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the fence and
Title:  shot away in the gloom.
Title:  
Title:     Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his drenched
Title:  garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he had any dim
Title:  idea of making any "references to allusions," he thought better of it and
Title:  held his peace, for there was danger in Tom's eye.
Title:  
Title:     Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental
Title:  note of the omission.
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                   Chapter IV
Title:  
Title:     THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
Title:  village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family worship:
Title:  it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of
Title:  Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of originality;
Title:  and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law,
Title:  as from Sinai.
Title:  
Title:     Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to "get his
Title:  verses." Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his energies
Title:  to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the Sermon on the
Title:  Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter. At the end of half
Title:  an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his
Title:  mind was traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were
Title:  busy with distracting recreations. Mary took his book to hear him recite,
Title:  and he tried to find his way through the fog:
Title:  
Title:     "Blessed are the -- a -- a -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Poor" --
Title:  
Title:     "Yes -- poor; blessed are the poor -- a -- a -- "
Title:  
Title:     "In spirit -- "
Title:  
Title:     "In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they -- they -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Theirs -- "
Title:  
Title:     "For theirs . Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
Title:  of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they -- they -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Sh -- "
Title:  
Title:     "For they -- a -- "
Title:  
Title:     "S, H, A -- "
Title:  
Title:     "For they S, H -- Oh, I don't know what it is!"
Title:  
Title:     "Shall!"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, shall! for they shall -- for they shall -- a -- a -- shall mourn --
Title:  a -- a -- blessed are they that shall -- they that -- a -- they that shall
Title:  mourn, for they shall -- a -- shall what? Why don't you tell me, Mary? --
Title:  what do you want to be so mean for?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you. I wouldn't do
Title:  that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be discouraged, Tom, you'll
Title:  manage it -- and if you do, I'll give you something ever so nice. There,
Title:  now, that's a good boy."
Title:  
Title:     "All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is."
Title:  
Title:     "Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it is nice."
Title:  
Title:     "You bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it again."
Title:  
Title:     And he did "tackle it again" -- and under the
Title:  double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit
Title:  that he accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new "Barlow"
Title:  knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that
Title:  swept his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut
Title:  anything, but it was a "sure-enough" Barlow, and there was inconceivable
Title:  grandeur in that -- though where the Western boys ever got the idea that
Title:  such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing
Title:  mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the
Title:  cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was
Title:  called off to dress for Sunday-school.
Title:  
Title:     Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
Title:  outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he dipped
Title:  the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves; poured out
Title:  the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to
Title:  wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But Mary removed the
Title:  towel and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water won't hurt
Title:  you."
Title:  
Title:     Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he
Title:  stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and
Title:  began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and
Title:  groping for the towel with
Title:  his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his
Title:  face. But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for
Title:  the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask;
Title:  below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that
Title:  spread downward in front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in
Title:  hand, and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without
Title:  distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its
Title:  short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He
Title:  privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered
Title:  his hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his
Title:  own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his
Title:  clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years -- they were
Title:  simply called his "other clothes" -- and so by that we know the size of his
Title:  wardrobe. The girl "put him to rights" after he had dressed himself; she
Title:  buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar
Title:  down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled
Title:  straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was
Title:  fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole
Title:  clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that Mary would forget his
Title:  shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as
Title:  was the
Title:  custom, and brought them out. He lost his temper and said he was always
Title:  being made to do everything he didn't want to do. But Mary said,
Title:  persuasively:
Title:  
Title:     "Please, Tom -- that's a good boy."
Title:  
Title:     So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three
Title:  children set out for Sunday-school -- a place that Tom hated with his whole
Title:  heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.
Title:  
Title:     Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
Title:  service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and
Title:  the other always remained too -- for stronger reasons. The church's
Title:  high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons; the
Title:  edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on
Title:  top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a
Title:  Sunday-dressed comrade:
Title:  
Title:     "Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes."
Title:  
Title:     "What'll you take for her?"
Title:  
Title:     "What'll you give?"
Title:  
Title:     "Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook."
Title:  
Title:     "Less see 'em."
Title:  
Title:     Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.
Title:  Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some
Title:  small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys as
Title:  they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen
Title:  minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy
Title:  boys and
Title:  girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that
Title:  came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his
Title:  back a moment and Tom pulled a boy's hair in the next bench, and was
Title:  absorbed in his book when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy,
Title:  presently, in order to hear him say "Ouch!" and got a new reprimand from his
Title:  teacher. Tom's whole class were of a pattern -- restless, noisy, and
Title:  troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew
Title:  his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they
Title:  worried through, and each got his reward -- in small blue tickets, each with
Title:  a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the
Title:  recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for
Title:  it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the
Title:  superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those
Title:  easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and
Title:  application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And yet
Title:  Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way -- it was the patient work of two
Title:  years -- and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once recited
Title:  three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental
Title:  faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that
Title:  day forth -- a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions,
Title:  before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made
Title:  this boy come out and "spread himself." Only the older pupils managed to
Title:  keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a
Title:  Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy
Title:  circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day
Title:  that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh ambition that
Title:  often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom's mental stomach had
Title:  never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire
Title:  being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with
Title:  it.
Title:  
Title:     In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a
Title:  closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves,
Title:  and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent makes his
Title:  customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the
Title:  inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the
Title:  platform and sings a solo at a concert -- though why, is a mystery: for
Title:  neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the
Title:  sufferer. This superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a
Title:  sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose
Title:  upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward
Title:  abreast the
Title:  corners of his mouth -- a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and
Title:  a turning of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was
Title:  propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note,
Title:  and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion
Title:  of the day, like sleigh-runners -- an effect patiently and laboriously
Title:  produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall
Title:  for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere
Title:  and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence,
Title:  and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself
Title:  his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly
Title:  absent on week-days. He began after this fashion:
Title:  
Title:     "Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
Title:  you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There -- that is
Title:  it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little
Title:  girl who is looking out of the window -- I am afraid she thinks I am out
Title:  there somewhere -- perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the
Title:  little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me
Title:  feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like
Title:  this, learning to do right and be good." And so forth and so on. It is not
Title:  necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which
Title:  does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.
Title:  
Title:     The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and
Title:  other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and
Title:  whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of
Title:  isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound
Title:  ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and the
Title:  conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.
Title:  
Title:     A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
Title:  more or less rare -- the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied
Title:  by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with
Title:  iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife.
Title:  The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and
Title:  repinings; conscience-smitten, too -- he could not meet Amy Lawrence's eye,
Title:  he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this small new-comer his
Title:  soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next moment he was "showing
Title:  off" with all his might -- cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces -- in a
Title:  word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her
Title:  applause. His exaltation had but one alloy -- the memory of his humiliation
Title:  in this angel's garden -- and that record in sand was fast washing out,
Title:  under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.
Title:  
Title:     The visitors were given the highest seat of honor,
Title:  and as soon as Mr. Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the
Title:  school. The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage -- no
Title:  less a one than the county judge -- altogether the most august creation
Title:  these children had ever looked upon -- and they wondered what kind of
Title:  material he was made of -- and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were
Title:  half afraid he might, too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away --
Title:  so he had travelled, and seen the world -- these very eyes had looked upon
Title:  the county court-house -- which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which
Title:  these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
Title:  ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their
Title:  own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with the
Title:  great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music to his soul
Title:  to hear the whisperings:
Title:  
Title:     "Look at him, Jim! He's a going up there. Say -- look! he's a going to
Title:  shake hands with him -- he is shaking hands with him! By jings, don't you
Title:  wish you was Jeff?"
Title:  
Title:     Mr. Walters fell to "showing off," with all sorts of official bustlings
Title:  and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions
Title:  here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The librarian "showed
Title:  off" -- running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a
Title:  deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in.
Title:  The young lady teachers "showed off" -- bending sweetly over pupils that
Title:  were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys
Title:  and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers "showed off"
Title:  with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine
Title:  attention to discipline -- and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found
Title:  business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that
Title:  frequently had to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming
Title:  vexation). The little girls "showed off" in various ways, and the little
Title:  boys "showed off" with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads
Title:  and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed
Title:  a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun
Title:  of his own grandeur -- for he was "showing off," too.
Title:  
Title:     There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy complete,
Title:  and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.
Title:  Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough -- he had been
Title:  around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now, to
Title:  have that German lad back again with a sound mind.
Title:  
Title:     And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with
Title:  nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a
Title:  Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting
Title:  an application from this source for the next ten years. But there was no
Title:  getting around it -- here were the certified checks, and they were good for
Title:  their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the
Title:  other elect, and the great news was announced from head-quarters. It was the
Title:  most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that
Title:  it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one's altitude, and the school had
Title:  two marvels to gaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with
Title:  envy -- but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived
Title:  too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by
Title:  trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing
Title:  privileges. These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a
Title:  guileful snake in the grass.
Title:  
Title:     The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
Title:  superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat
Title:  of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught him that there was a
Title:  mystery here that could not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply
Title:  preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural
Title:  wisdom on his premises -- a dozen would strain his capacity, without a
Title:  doubt.
Title:  
Title:     Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in her
Title:  face -- but he wouldn't look. She wondered; then she was just a grain
Title:  troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went -- came again; she watched; a
Title:  furtive glance told her
Title:  worlds -- and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the
Title:  tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most of all (she thought).
Title:  
Title:     Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath
Title:  would hardly come, his heart quaked -- partly because of the awful greatness
Title:  of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would have liked to
Title:  fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The Judge put his hand on
Title:  Tom's head and called him a fine little man, and asked him what his name
Title:  was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, no, not Tom -- it is -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Thomas."
Title:  
Title:     "Ah, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's very well.
Title:  But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to me, won't you?"
Title:  
Title:     "Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas," said Walters, "and say sir
Title:  . You mustn't forget your manners."
Title:  
Title:     "Thomas Sawyer -- sir."
Title:  
Title:     "That's it! That's a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two
Title:  thousand verses is a great many -- very, very great many. And you never can
Title:  be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth more
Title:  than anything there is in the world; it's what makes great men and good men;
Title:  you'll
Title:  be a great man and a good man yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you'll
Title:  look back and say, It's all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges
Title:  of my boyhood -- it's all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn
Title:  -- it's all owing to the good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched
Title:  over me, and gave me a beautiful Bible -- a splendid elegant Bible -- to
Title:  keep and have it all for my own, always -- it's all owing to right bringing
Title:  up! That is what you will say, Thomas -- and you wouldn't take any money for
Title:  those two thousand verses -- no indeed you wouldn't. And now you wouldn't
Title:  mind telling me and this lady some of the things you've learned -- no, I
Title:  know you wouldn't -- for we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no
Title:  doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won't you tell us the
Title:  names of the first two that were appointed?"
Title:  
Title:     Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed, now,
Title:  and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters' heart sank within him. He said to himself,
Title:  it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question -- why did
Title:  the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up and say:
Title:  
Title:     "Answer the gentleman, Thomas -- don't be afraid."
Title:  
Title:     Tom still hung fire.
Title:  
Title:     "Now I know you'll tell me," said the lady. "The names of the first two
Title:  disciples were -- "
Title:  
Title:     "DAVID AND GOLIAH!"
Title:  
Title:     Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.
Title:

Title:  
Title:                                    Chapter V
Title:  
Title:     ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,
Title:  and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The
Title:  Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied
Title:  pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt Polly came, and
Title:  Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her -- Tom being placed next the aisle, in
Title:  order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive
Title:  outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up the aisles: the aged
Title:  and needy postmaster, who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife --
Title:  for they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries; the justice of the
Title:  peace; the widow Douglass, fair, smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted
Title:  soul and well-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the
Title:  most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that
Title:  St. Petersburg could boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward;
Title:  lawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of the
Title:  village, followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young
Title:  heart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a
Title:  body -- for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a
Title:  circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run
Title:  their gantlet; and last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking
Title:  as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass. He always brought
Title:  his mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons. The boys all
Title:  hated him, he was so good. And besides, he had been "thrown up to them" so
Title:  much. His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual
Title:  on Sundays -- accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys
Title:  who had as snobs.
Title:  
Title:     The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more, to
Title:  warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church
Title:  which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the
Title:  gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all through service. There
Title:  was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it
Title:  was, now. It was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember
Title:  anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.
Title:  
Title:     The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a
Title:  peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His voice
Title:  began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain
Title:  point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then
Title:  plunged down as if from a spring-board:
Title:  
Title:  Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry beds
Title:  of ease,
Title:  Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' blood
Title:  -y seas?
Title:  
Title:     He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church "sociables" he was
Title:  always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would
Title:  lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and "wall"
Title:  their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, "Words cannot express
Title:  it; it is too beautiful, too beautiful for this mortal earth."
Title:  
Title:     After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a
Title:  bulletin-board, and read off "notices" of meetings and societies and things
Title:  till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom -- a
Title:  queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in
Title:  this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a
Title:  traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.
Title:  
Title:     And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went
Title:  into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
Title:  church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for
Title:  the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United States;
Title:  for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the President; for
Title:  the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for
Title:  the oppressed millions
Title:  groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for
Title:  such as have the light and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see
Title:  nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and
Title:  closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find
Title:  grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
Title:  grateful harvest of good. Amen.
Title:  
Title:     There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.
Title:  The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only
Title:  endured it -- if he even did that much. He was restive all through it; he
Title:  kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously -- for he was not
Title:  listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular route
Title:  over it -- and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear
Title:  detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions
Title:  unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the
Title:  back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing
Title:  its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so
Title:  vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the
Title:  slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its
Title:  hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails;
Title:  going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly
Title:  safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's hands
Title:  itched to grab for it they did not dare -- he believed his soul would be
Title:  instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on.
Title:  But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and
Title:  the instant the "Amen" was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt
Title:  detected the act and made him let it go.
Title:  
Title:     The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an
Title:  argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod -- and
Title:  yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and
Title:  thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly
Title:  worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he
Title:  always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else
Title:  about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested for a
Title:  little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling
Title:  together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb
Title:  should lie down together and a little child should lead them. But the
Title:  pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy;
Title:  he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the
Title:  on-looking nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself
Title:  that he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.
Title:  
Title:     Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.
Title:  Presently he bethought
Title:  him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a large black beetle with
Title:  formidable jaws -- a "pinchbug," he called it. It was in a percussion-cap
Title:  box. The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural
Title:  fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its
Title:  back, and the hurt finger went into the boy's mouth. The beetle lay there
Title:  working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for
Title:  it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the
Title:  sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant
Title:  poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness
Title:  and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle;
Title:  the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around
Title:  it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder,
Title:  and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at
Title:  it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the
Title:  diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and
Title:  continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and
Title:  absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and
Title:  touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the
Title:  poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its
Title:  back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy,
Title:  several faces went behind
Title:  fans and handkerchiefs, and Tomwas entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,
Title:  and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a
Title:  craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it
Title:  again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his
Title:  fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it
Title:  with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he
Title:  grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but
Title:  found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor,
Title:  and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and
Title:  sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went
Title:  sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed
Title:  the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed
Title:  before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his
Title:  progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with
Title:  the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from
Title:  its course, and sprang into its master's lap; he flung it out of the window,
Title:  and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.
Title:  
Title:     By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
Title:  suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. The
Title:  discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all
Title:  possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even
Title:  the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst
Title:  of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson
Title:  had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole
Title:  congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.
Title:  
Title:     Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was
Title:  some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in
Title:  it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog should play
Title:  with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it
Title:  off.
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                   Chapter VI
Title:  
Title:     MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found
Title:  him so -- because it began another week's slow suffering in school. He
Title:  generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it
Title:  made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.
Title:  
Title:     Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
Title:  sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility. He
Title:  canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated again. This
Title:  time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage
Title:  them with considerable hope. But they soon grew feeble, and presently died
Title:  wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of
Title:  his upper front teeth was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin to
Title:  groan, as a "starter," as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he
Title:  came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that
Title:  would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the
Title:  present, and seek further. Nothing offered for some little time, and then he
Title:  remembered hearing the
Title:  doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three
Title:  weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly drew his
Title:  sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection. But now he did
Title:  not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed well worth while to
Title:  chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.
Title:  
Title:     But Sid slept on unconscious.
Title:  
Title:     Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.
Title:  
Title:     No result from Sid.
Title:  
Title:     Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then
Title:  swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.
Title:  
Title:     Sid snored on.
Title:  
Title:     Tom was aggravated. He said, "Sid, Sid!" and shook him. This course
Title:  worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then
Title:  brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. Tom
Title:  went on groaning. Sid said:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom! Say, Tom!" [No response.] "Here, Tom! Tom! What is the matter,
Title:  Tom?" And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.
Title:  
Title:     Tom moaned out:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie."
Title:  
Title:     "No -- never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody."
Title:  
Title:     "But I must! Don't groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this
Title:  way?"
Title:  
Title:     "Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner ? Oh, Tom, don't ! It makes my flesh
Title:  crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?"
Title:  
Title:     "I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever done to
Title:  me. When I'm gone -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom -- oh, don't. Maybe -- "
Title:  
Title:     "I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you give
Title:  my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to town,
Title:  and tell her -- "
Title:  
Title:     But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,
Title:  now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had
Title:  gathered quite a genuine tone.
Title:  
Title:     Sid flew down-stairs and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!"
Title:  
Title:     "Dying!"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes'm. Don't wait -- come quick!"
Title:  
Title:     "Rubbage! I don't believe it!"
Title:  
Title:     But she fled up-stairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels. And
Title:  her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the
Title:  bed-side she gasped out:
Title:  
Title:     "You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, auntie, I'm -- "
Title:  
Title:     "What's the matter with you -- what is the matter with you, child?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!"
Title:  
Title:     The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
Title:  little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and
Title:  climb out of this."
Title:  
Title:     The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a
Title:  little foolish, and he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Aunt Polly, it seemed mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth
Title:  at all."
Title:  
Title:     "Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?"
Title:  
Title:     "One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful."
Title:  
Title:     "There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.
Title:  Well -- your tooth IS loose, but you're not going to die about that. Mary,
Title:  get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen."
Title:  
Title:     Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish I
Title:  may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay home
Title:  from school."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought you'd
Title:  get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you
Title:  so, and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your
Title:  outrageousness." By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old
Title:  lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop and
Title:  tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and
Title:  suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face. The tooth hung dangling by
Title:  the bedpost, now.
Title:  
Title:     But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after
Title:  breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper
Title:  row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way. He
Title:  gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition; and one
Title:  that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up
Title:  to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of
Title:  his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not
Title:  feel that it wasn't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said,
Title:  "Sour grapes!" and he wandered away a dismantled hero.
Title:  
Title:     Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry
Title:  Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded
Title:  by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar
Title:  and bad -- and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in
Title:  his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like
Title:  the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his
Title:  gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to play with him.
Title:  So he played with him every time he got a chance. Huckleberry was always
Title:  dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they were in
Title:  perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a
Title:  wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung
Title:  nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one
Title:  suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and
Title:  contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.
Title:  
Title:     Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in
Title:  fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school
Title:  or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing
Title:  or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him;
Title:  nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was
Title:  always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume
Title:  leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he
Title:  could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that goes to make life
Title:  precious that boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy
Title:  in St. Petersburg.
Title:  
Title:     Tom hailed the romantic outcast:
Title:  
Title:     "Hello, Huckleberry!"
Title:  
Title:     "Hello yourself, and see how you like it."
Title:  
Title:     "What's that you got?"
Title:  
Title:     "Dead cat."
Title:  
Title:     "Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him ?"
Title:  
Title:     "Bought him off'n a boy."
Title:  
Title:     "What did you give?"
Title:  
Title:     "I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house."
Title:  
Title:     "Where'd you get the blue ticket?"
Title:  
Title:     "Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick."
Title:  
Title:     "Say -- what is dead cats good for, Huck?"
Title:  
Title:     "Good for? Cure warts with."
Title:  
Title:     "No! Is that so? I know something that's better."
Title:  
Title:     "I bet you don't. What is it?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, spunk-water."
Title:  
Title:     "Spunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water."
Title:  
Title:     "You wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?"
Title:  
Title:     "No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did."
Title:  
Title:     "Who told you so!"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told
Title:  Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger
Title:  told me. There now!"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don't
Title:  know him . But I never see a nigger that wouldn't lie. Shucks! Now you tell
Title:  me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water
Title:  was."
Title:  
Title:     "In the daytime?"
Title:  
Title:     "Certainly."
Title:  
Title:     "With his face to the stump?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes. Least I reckon so."
Title:  
Title:     "Did he say anything?"
Title:  
Title:     "I don't reckon he did. I don't know."
Title:  
Title:     "Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool
Title:  way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You got to go all by
Title:  yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there's a spunk-water
Title:  stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your
Title:  hand in and say:
Title:  
Title:       'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,
Title:       Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,'
Title:  
Title:  and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn
Title:  around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you
Title:  speak the charm's busted."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner
Title:  done."
Title:  
Title:     "No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this
Title:  town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work
Title:  spunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,
Title:  Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many
Title:  warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, bean's good. I've done that."
Title:  
Title:     "Have you? What's your way?"
Title:  
Title:     "You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,
Title:  and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole
Title:  and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and
Title:  then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece that's got the
Title:  blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece
Title:  to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she
Title:  comes."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, that's it, Huck -- that's it; though when you're burying it if you
Title:  say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better. That's
Title:  the way Joe Harper does, and he's been nearly to Coonville and most
Title:  everywheres. But say -- how do you cure 'em with dead cats?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard 'long about
Title:  midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's
Title:  midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see 'em,
Title:  you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk; and when
Title:  they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em and say,
Title:  'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm done with ye!'
Title:  That'll fetch ANY wart."
Title:  
Title:     "Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?"
Title:  
Title:     "No, but old Mother Hopkins told me."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a witch."
Title:  
Title:     "Say! Why, Tom, I know she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own self.
Title:  He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he took up a
Title:  rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her. Well, that very night he
Title:  rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?"
Title:  
Title:     "Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right
Title:  stiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they
Title:  mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer backards."
Title:  
Title:     "Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?"
Title:  
Title:     "To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams to-night."
Title:  
Title:     "But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight? -- and
Title:  then it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I don't
Title:  reckon."
Title:  
Title:     "I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?"
Title:  
Title:     "Of course -- if you ain't afeard."
Title:  
Title:     "Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes -- and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep' me
Title:  a-meowing around till old
Title:  Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a
Title:  brick through his window -- but don't you tell."
Title:  
Title:     "I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but
Title:  I'll meow this time. Say -- what's that?"
Title:  
Title:     "Nothing but a tick."
Title:  
Title:     "Where'd you get him?"
Title:  
Title:     "Out in the woods."
Title:  
Title:     "What'll you take for him?"
Title:  
Title:     "I don't know. I don't want to sell him."
Title:  
Title:     "All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm satisfied
Title:  with it. It's a good enough tick for me."
Title:  
Title:     "Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if I wanted
Title:  to."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This is a
Title:  pretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've seen this year."
Title:  
Title:     "Say, Huck -- I'll give you my tooth for him."
Title:  
Title:     "Less see it."
Title:  
Title:     Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed
Title:  it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Is it genuwyne?"
Title:  
Title:     Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.
Title:  
Title:     "Well, all right," said Huckleberry, "it's a trade."
Title:  
Title:     Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box
Title:  that had lately been the pinchbug's prison, and the boys separated, each
Title:  feeling wealthier than before.
Title:  
Title:     When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in
Title:  briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He hung
Title:  his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like
Title:  alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair,
Title:  was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The interruption roused him.
Title:  
Title:     "Thomas Sawyer!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.
Title:  
Title:     "Sir!"
Title:  
Title:     "Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?"
Title:  
Title:     Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of
Title:  yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy
Title:  of love; and by that form was the only vacant place on the girls' side of
Title:  the school-house. He instantly said:
Title:  
Title:     "I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN!"
Title:  
Title:     The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of
Title:  study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind.
Title:  The master said:
Title:  
Title:     "You -- you did what?"
Title:  
Title:     "Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn."
Title:  
Title:     There was no mistaking the words.
Title:  
Title:     "Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever
Title:  listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your
Title:  jacket."
Title:  
Title:     The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches
Title:  notably diminished. Then the order followed:
Title:  
Title:     "Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you."
Title:  
Title:     The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in
Title:  reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his
Title:  unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune. He
Title:  sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away
Title:  from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed
Title:  the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before
Title:  him, and seemed to study his book.
Title:  
Title:     By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur
Title:  rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal furtive
Title:  glances at the girl. She observed it, "made a mouth" at him and gave him the
Title:  back of her head for the space of a minute. When she cautiously faced around
Title:  again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it away. Tom gently put it back.
Title:  She thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it
Title:  to its place. Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, "Please
Title:  take
Title:  it -- I got more." The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the
Title:  boy began to draw something on the slate, hiding his work with his left
Title:  hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity
Title:  presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy
Title:  worked on, apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal
Title:  attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last
Title:  she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:
Title:  
Title:     "Let me see it."
Title:  
Title:     Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends
Title:  to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl's
Title:  interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything
Title:  else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:
Title:  
Title:     "It's nice -- make a man."
Title:  
Title:     The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He
Title:  could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she
Title:  was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:
Title:  
Title:     "It's a beautiful man -- now make me coming along."
Title:  
Title:     Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed
Title:  the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:
Title:  
Title:     "It's ever so nice -- I wish I could draw."
Title:  
Title:     "It's easy," whispered Tom, "I'll learn you."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, will you? When"
Title:  
Title:     "At noon. Do you go home to dinner?"
Title:  
Title:     "I'll stay if you will."
Title:  
Title:     "Good -- that's a whack. What's your name?"
Title:  
Title:     "Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer."
Title:  
Title:     "That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me Tom,
Title:  will you?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes."
Title:  
Title:     Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from the
Title:  girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, it ain't anything."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes it is."
Title:  
Title:     "No it ain't. You don't want to see."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me."
Title:  
Title:     "You'll tell."
Title:  
Title:     "No I won't -- deed and deed and double deed won't."
Title:  
Title:     "You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?"
Title:  
Title:     "No, I won't ever tell anybody. Now let me."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, you don't want to see!"
Title:  
Title:     "Now that you treat me so, I will see." And she put her small hand upon
Title:  his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but
Title:  letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed: "I LOVE
Title:  YOU."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, you bad thing!" And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and
Title:  looked pleased, nevertheless.
Title:  
Title:     Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his
Title:  ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that vise he was borne across the
Title:  house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles from
Title:  the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful moments,
Title:  and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But although
Title:  Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.
Title:  
Title:     As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the
Title:  turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the reading
Title:  class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and turned lakes
Title:  into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents, till
Title:  chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and got "turned down," by
Title:  a succession of mere baby words, till he brought up at the foot and yielded
Title:  up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.
Title:

Title:  
Title:                                   Chapter VII
Title:  
Title:     THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas
Title:  wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed to
Title:  him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead. There
Title:  was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing
Title:  murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the
Title:  spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine,
Title:  Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat,
Title:  tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in
Title:  the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were
Title:  asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest
Title:  to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his
Title:  face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know
Title:  it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and
Title:  put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude
Title:  that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when
Title:  he started
Title:  thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take
Title:  a new direction.
Title:  
Title:     Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and now
Title:  he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant.
Title:  This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn friends all the
Title:  week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of his lapel
Title:  and began to assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest
Title:  momently. Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and
Title:  neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he put Joe's slate on
Title:  the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom.
Title:  
Title:     "Now," said he, "as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and
Title:  I'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side, you're
Title:  to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over."
Title:  
Title:     "All right, go ahead; start him up."
Title:  
Title:     The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe
Title:  harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This
Title:  change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with
Title:  absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the two
Title:  heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all things
Title:  else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this,
Title:  that, and the other course, and got as excited and as
Title:  anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have
Title:  victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be twitching
Title:  to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At last
Title:  Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong. So he reached
Title:  out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment. Said he:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, you let him alone."
Title:  
Title:     "I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe."
Title:  
Title:     "No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone."
Title:  
Title:     "Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much."
Title:  
Title:     "Let him alone, I tell you."
Title:  
Title:     "I won't!"
Title:  
Title:     "You shall -- he's on my side of the line."
Title:  
Title:     "Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?"
Title:  
Title:     " I don't care whose tick he is -- he's on my side of the line, and you
Title:  sha'n't touch him."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do what I
Title:  blame please with him, or die!"
Title:  
Title:     A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its duplicate on
Title:  Joe's; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the
Title:  two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been too absorbed
Title:  to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the
Title:  master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them. He had contemplated
Title:  a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to
Title:  it.
Title:  
Title:     When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered
Title:  in her ear:
Title:  
Title:     "Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to the
Title:  corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the lane and
Title:  come back. I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same way."
Title:  
Title:     So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with
Title:  another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and when
Title:  they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they sat
Title:  together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil and held
Title:  her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising house. When
Title:  the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming
Title:  in bliss. He said:
Title:  
Title:     "Do you love rats?"
Title:  
Title:     "No! I hate them!"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I do, too -- live ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your
Title:  head with a string."
Title:  
Title:     "No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now."
Title:  
Title:     "Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give it
Title:  back to me."
Title:  
Title:     That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs
Title:  against the bench in excess of contentment.
Title:  
Title:     "Was you ever at a circus?" said Tom.
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good."
Title:  
Title:     "I been to the circus three or four times -- lots of times. Church ain't
Title:  shucks to a circus. There's things going on at a circus all the time. I'm
Title:  going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted up."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money -- most a dollar a day,
Title:  Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?"
Title:  
Title:     "What's that?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, engaged to be married."
Title:  
Title:     "No."
Title:  
Title:     "Would you like to?"
Title:  
Title:     "I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?"
Title:  
Title:     "Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't
Title:  ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that's all.
Title:  Anybody can do it."
Title:  
Title:     "Kiss? What do you kiss for?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, that, you know, is to -- well, they always do that."
Title:  
Title:     "Everybody?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember what
Title:  I wrote on the slate?"
Title:  
Title:     "Ye -- yes."
Title:  
Title:     "What was it?"
Title:  
Title:     "I sha'n't tell you."
Title:  
Title:     "Shall I tell you?"
Title:  
Title:     "Ye -- yes -- but some other time."
Title:  
Title:     "No, now."
Title:  
Title:     "No, not now -- to-morrow."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, no, now. Please, Becky -- I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so
Title:  easy."
Title:  
Title:     Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about
Title:  her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to her
Title:  ear. And then he added:
Title:  
Title:     "Now you whisper it to me -- just the same."
Title:  
Title:     She resisted, for a while, and then said:
Title:  
Title:     "You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But you
Title:  mustn't ever tell anybody -- will you, Tom? Now you won't, will you?"
Title:  
Title:     "No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky."
Title:  
Title:     He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred
Title:  his curls and whispered, "I -- love -- you!"
Title:  
Title:     Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,
Title:  with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little
Title:  white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:
Title:  
Title:     "Now, Becky, it's all done -- all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid
Title:  of that -- it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky." And he tugged at her
Title:  apron and the hands.
Title:  
Title:     By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop;
Title:  her face, all glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed
Title:  the red lips and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain't
Title:  ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me,
Title:  ever never and forever. Will you?"
Title:  
Title:     "No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry anybody
Title:  but you -- and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either."
Title:  
Title:     "Certainly. Of course. That's part of it. And always coming to school or
Title:  when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there ain't anybody
Title:  looking -- and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because that's the
Title:  way you do when you're engaged."
Title:  
Title:     "It's so nice. I never heard of it before."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence -- "
Title:  
Title:     The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!"
Title:  
Title:     The child began to cry. Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, you do, Tom -- you know you do."
Title:  
Title:     Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and
Title:  turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with
Title:  soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again.
Title:  Then his pride was up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about,
Title:  restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then,
Title:  hoping she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began
Title:  to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle with
Title:  him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and entered. She
Title:  was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with her face to the
Title:  wall. Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a moment, not knowing
Title:  exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:
Title:  
Title:     "Becky, I -- I don't care for anybody but you."
Title:  
Title:     No reply -- but sobs.
Title:  
Title:     "Becky" -- pleadingly. "Becky, won't you say something?"
Title:  
Title:     More sobs.
Title:  
Title:     Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,
Title:  and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Please, Becky, won't you take it?"
Title:  
Title:     She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over
Title:  the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently
Title:  Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she flew
Title:  around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom! Come back, Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions but
Title:  silence and loneliness.
Title:  So she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself; and by this time the
Title:  scholars began to gather again, and she had to hide her griefs and still her
Title:  broken heart and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with
Title:  none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with.

Title:  
Title:                                  Chapter VIII
Title:  
Title:     TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the
Title:  track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed a
Title:  small "branch" two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile
Title:  superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later he was
Title:  disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill, and
Title:  the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind
Title:  him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it,
Title:  and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak. There was not even a
Title:  zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the
Title:  birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional
Title:  far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and this seemed to render the pervading
Title:  silence and sense of loneliness the more profound. The boy's soul was
Title:  steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his
Title:  surroundings. He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his
Title:  hands, meditating. It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best,
Title:  and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it must be
Title:  very peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever,
Title:  with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the
Title:  flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any
Title:  more. If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go,
Title:  and be done with it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He
Title:  had meant the best in the world, and been treated like a dog -- like a very
Title:  dog. She would be sorry some day -- maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he
Title:  could only die temporarily!
Title:  
Title:     But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained
Title:  shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the
Title:  concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and
Title:  disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away -- ever so far away, into
Title:  unknown countries beyond the seas -- and never came back any more! How would
Title:  she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only to fill
Title:  him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an
Title:  offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into
Title:  the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be a soldier, and
Title:  return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious. No -- better still,
Title:  he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the
Title:  mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of
Title:  the Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with
Title:  feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy
Title:  summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of
Title:  all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was something
Title:  gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it! Now his future
Title:  lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor. How his name
Title:  would fill the world, and make people shudder! How gloriously he would go
Title:  plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled racer, the Spirit
Title:  of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the fore! And at the zenith of
Title:  his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into
Title:  church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet doublet and trunks,
Title:  his great jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt bristling with
Title:  horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his slouch hat with
Title:  waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull and crossbones on it,
Title:  and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings, "It's Tom Sawyer the Pirate!
Title:  -- the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!"
Title:  
Title:     Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from
Title:  home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore he
Title:  must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together. He
Title:  went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with
Title:  his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that
Title:  sounded hollow. He put his hand there and uttered this incantation
Title:  impressively:
Title:  
Title:     "What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!"
Title:  
Title:     Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it up
Title:  and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of
Title:  shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom's astonishment was boundless! He scratched
Title:  his head with a perplexed air, and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, that beats anything!"
Title:  
Title:     Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The truth
Title:  was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and all his
Title:  comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a marble with
Title:  certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then
Title:  opened the place with the incantation he had just used, you would find that
Title:  all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there,
Title:  meantime, no matter how widely they had been separated. But now, this thing
Title:  had actually and unquestionably failed. Tom's whole structure of faith was
Title:  shaken to its foundations. He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding
Title:  but never of its failing before. It did not occur to him that he had tried
Title:  it several times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places
Title:  afterward. He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that
Title:  some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy
Title:  himself on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy
Title:  spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and
Title:  put his mouth close to this depression and called --
Title:  
Title:     "Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,
Title:  doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!"
Title:  
Title:     The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a
Title:  second and then darted under again in a fright.
Title:  
Title:     "He dasn't tell! So it was a witch that done it. I just knowed it."
Title:  
Title:     He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he
Title:  gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have the
Title:  marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a patient
Title:  search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his
Title:  treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing
Title:  when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his pocket
Title:  and tossed it in the same way, saying:
Title:  
Title:     "Brother, go find your brother!"
Title:  
Title:     He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must have
Title:  fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last repetition
Title:  was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each other.
Title:  
Title:     Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green
Title:  aisles of the forest. Tom
Title:  flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a suspender into a belt, raked
Title:  away some brush behind the rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a
Title:  lath sword and a tin trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and
Title:  bounded away, barelegged, with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a
Title:  great elm, blew an answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily
Title:  out, this way and that. He said cautiously -- to an imaginary company:
Title:  
Title:     "Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow."
Title:  
Title:     Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom. Tom
Title:  called:
Title:  
Title:     "Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?"
Title:  
Title:     "Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that -- that -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Dares to hold such language," said Tom, prompting -- for they talked "by
Title:  the book," from memory.
Title:  
Title:     "Who art thou that dares to hold such language?"
Title:  
Title:     "I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know."
Title:  
Title:     "Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute
Title:  with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!"
Title:  
Title:     They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,
Title:  struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat,
Title:  "two up and two down." Presently Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!"
Title:  
Title:     So they "went it lively," panting and perspiring with the work. By and by
Title:  Tom shouted:
Title:  
Title:     "Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?"
Title:  
Title:     "I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of it."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the
Title:  book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of
Title:  Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit you in the back."
Title:  
Title:     There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the
Title:  whack and fell.
Title:  
Title:     "Now," said Joe, getting up, "you got to let me kill you. That's fair."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, it's blamed mean -- that's all."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and lam
Title:  me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be
Title:  Robin Hood a little while and kill me."
Title:  
Title:     This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then Tom
Title:  became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his
Title:  strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe, representing a
Title:  whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into
Title:  his feeble hands, and Tom said, "Where this arrow falls, there bury poor
Title:  Robin Hood under the greenwood tree." Then he shot the arrow and fell back
Title:  and would have died, but he
Title:  lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.
Title:  
Title:     The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off
Title:  grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern
Title:  civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss. They
Title:  said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than President
Title:  of the United States forever.
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                   Chapter IX
Title:  
Title:     AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.
Title:  They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and waited,
Title:  in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be nearly
Title:  daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He would have
Title:  tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake
Title:  Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally
Title:  still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely perceptible noises
Title:  began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring
Title:  itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs
Title:  creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore
Title:  issued from Aunt Polly's chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket
Title:  that no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a
Title:  death-watch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder -- it meant that
Title:  somebody's days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the
Title:  night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom
Title:  was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity
Title:  begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but
Title:  he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed
Title:  dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window
Title:  disturbed him. A cry of "Scat! you devil!" and the crash of an empty bottle
Title:  against the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single
Title:  minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the
Title:  roof of the "ell" on all fours. He "meow'd" with caution once or twice, as
Title:  he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground.
Title:  Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and
Title:  disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading
Title:  through the tall grass of the graveyard.
Title:  
Title:     It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,
Title:  about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence around
Title:  it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the time, but
Title:  stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery.
Title:  All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place;
Title:  round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for
Title:  support and finding none. "Sacred to the memory of" So-
Title:  and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have been read,
Title:  on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.
Title:  
Title:     A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the
Title:  spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked little,
Title:  and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the pervading
Title:  solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the sharp new heap
Title:  they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the protection of three
Title:  great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.
Title:  
Title:     Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of a
Title:  distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom's
Title:  reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a
Title:  whisper:
Title:  
Title:     "Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?"
Title:  
Title:     Huckleberry whispered:
Title:  
Title:     "I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, ain't it?"
Title:  
Title:     "I bet it is."
Title:  
Title:     There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter
Title:  inwardly. Then Tom whispered:
Title:  
Title:     "Say, Hucky -- do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?"
Title:  
Title:     "O' course he does. Least his sperrit does."
Title:  
Title:     Tom, after a pause:
Title:  
Title:     "I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody
Title:  calls him Hoss."
Title:  
Title:     "A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead
Title:  people, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     This was a damper, and conversation died again.
Title:  
Title:     Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Sh!"
Title:  
Title:     "What is it, Tom?" And the two clung together with beating hearts.
Title:  
Title:     "Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?"
Title:  
Title:     "I -- "
Title:  
Title:     "There! Now you hear it."
Title:  
Title:     "Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?"
Title:  
Title:     "I dono. Think they'll see us?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't come."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't doing
Title:  any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us at all."
Title:  
Title:     "I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver."
Title:  
Title:     "Listen!"
Title:  
Title:     The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound
Title:  of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.
Title:  
Title:     "Look! See there!" whispered Tom. "What is it?"
Title:  
Title:     "It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful."
Title:  
Title:     Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
Title:  old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled
Title:  the ground with innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry
Title:  whispered with a shudder:
Title:  
Title:     "It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners! Can
Title:  you pray?"
Title:  
Title:     "I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now I
Title:  lay me down to sleep, I -- '"
Title:  
Title:     "Sh!"
Title:  
Title:     "What is it, Huck?"
Title:  
Title:     "They're humans! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff Potter's
Title:  voice."
Title:  
Title:     "No -- 'tain't so, is it?"
Title:  
Title:     "I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp enough to
Title:  notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely -- blamed old rip!"
Title:  
Title:     "All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here they
Title:  come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They're p'inted
Title:  right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o' them voices; it's Injun Joe."
Title:  
Title:     "That's so -- that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a
Title:  dern sight. What kin they be up to?"
Title:  
Title:     The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the grave
Title:  and stood within a few feet of the boys' hiding-place.
Title:  
Title:     "Here it is," said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern
Title:  up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.
Title:  
Title:     Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow
Title:  with a rope and a couple of shovels on it. They cast down their load and
Title:  began to open the grave. The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave
Title:  and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so
Title:  close the boys could have touched him.
Title:  
Title:     "Hurry, men!" he said, in a low voice; "the moon might come out at any
Title:  moment."
Title:  
Title:     They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no
Title:  noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould
Title:  and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon the coffin
Title:  with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two the men had
Title:  hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with their shovels, got
Title:  out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The moon drifted from
Title:  behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face. The barrow was got ready and
Title:  the corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its place with
Title:  the rope. Potter took out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end
Title:  of the rope and then said:
Title:  
Title:     "Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with another
Title:  five, or here she stays."
Title:  
Title:     "That's the talk!" said Injun Joe.
Title:  
Title:     "Look here, what does this mean?" said the doctor. "You required your pay
Title:  in advance, and I've paid you."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, and you done more than that," said Injun
Title:  Joe, approaching the doctor, who was now standing. "Five years ago you drove
Title:  me away from your father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for
Title:  something to eat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and when I swore
Title:  I'd get even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed
Title:  for a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for
Title:  nothing. And now I've got you, and you got to settle, you know!"
Title:  
Title:     He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.
Title:  The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.
Title:  Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:
Title:  
Title:     "Here, now, don't you hit my pard!" and the next moment he had grappled
Title:  with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main, trampling
Title:  the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe sprang to his
Title:  feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter's knife, and went
Title:  creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about the combatants,
Title:  seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung himself free, seized
Title:  the heavy headboard of Williams' grave and felled Potter to the earth with
Title:  it -- and in the same instant the half-breed saw his chance and drove the
Title:  knife to the hilt in the young man's breast. He reeled and fell partly upon
Title:  Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in the same moment the clouds
Title:  blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding
Title:  away in the dark.
Title:  
Title:     Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the
Title:  two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave a
Title:  long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:
Title:  
Title:     "That score is settled -- damn you."
Title:  
Title:     Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's
Title:  open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three -- four --
Title:  five minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed
Title:  upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a
Title:  shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and
Title:  then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.
Title:  
Title:     "Lord, how is this, Joe?" he said.
Title:  
Title:     "It's a dirty business," said Joe, without moving.
Title:  
Title:     "What did you do it for?"
Title:  
Title:     "I! I never done it!"
Title:  
Title:     "Look here! That kind of talk won't wash."
Title:  
Title:     Potter trembled and grew white.
Title:  
Title:     "I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's in
Title:  my head yet -- worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle; can't
Title:  recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe -- honest, now, old feller --
Title:  did I do it? Joe, I never meant to -- 'pon my soul and honor, I never meant
Title:  to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful -- and him so young and
Title:  promising."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you
Title:  one with the headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling
Title:  and staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as
Title:  he fetched you another awful clip -- and here you've laid, as dead as a
Title:  wedge til now."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I
Title:  did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon. I
Title:  never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I've fought, but never with
Title:  weepons. They'll all say that. Joe, don't tell! Say you won't tell, Joe --
Title:  that's a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too.
Title:  Don't you remember? You won't tell, will you, Joe?" And the poor creature
Title:  dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his appealing
Title:  hands.
Title:  
Title:     "No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won't
Title:  go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can say."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I
Title:  live." And Potter began to cry.
Title:  
Title:     "Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering.
Title:  You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any
Title:  tracks behind you."
Title:  
Title:     Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed
Title:  stood looking after him. He muttered:
Title:  
Title:     "If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had
Title:  the look of being, he
Title:  won't think of the knife till he's gone so far he'll be afraid to come back
Title:  after it to such a place by himself -- chicken-heart!"
Title:  
Title:     Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the
Title:  lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the moon's.
Title:  The stillness was complete again, too.

Title:                                    Chapter X
Title:  
Title:     THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with horror.
Title:  They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,
Title:  apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump that
Title:  started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them catch
Title:  their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the
Title:  village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their
Title:  feet.
Title:  
Title:     "If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!" whispered
Title:  Tom, in short catches between breaths. "I can't stand it much longer."
Title:  
Title:     Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed their
Title:  eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it. They
Title:  gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst through the
Title:  open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond.
Title:  By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:
Title:  
Title:     "Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?"
Title:  
Title:     "If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it."
Title:  
Title:     "Do you though?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, I know it, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     Tom thought a while, then he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Who'll tell? We?"
Title:  
Title:     "What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe
Title:  didn't hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as
Title:  we're a laying here."
Title:  
Title:     "That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck."
Title:  
Title:     "If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's
Title:  generally drunk enough."
Title:  
Title:     Tom said nothing -- went on thinking. Presently he whispered:
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?"
Title:  
Title:     "What's the reason he don't know it?"
Title:  
Title:     "Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon he
Title:  could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?"
Title:  
Title:     "By hokey, that's so, Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     "And besides, look-a-here -- maybe that whack done for him!"
Title:  
Title:     "No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and
Title:  besides, he always has. Well, when pap's full, you might take and belt him
Title:  over the head with a church and you couldn't phase him. He says so, his own
Title:  self. So it's the same with
Title:  Muff Potter, of course. But if a man was dead sober, I reckon maybe that
Title:  whack might fetch him; I dono."
Title:  
Title:     After another reflective silence, Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?"
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, we got to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't make
Title:  any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak 'bout
Title:  this and they didn't hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to
Title:  one another -- that's what we got to do -- swear to keep mum."
Title:  
Title:     "I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear
Title:  that we -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Oh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little rubbishy
Title:  common things -- specially with gals, cuz they go back on you anyway, and
Title:  blab if they get in a huff -- but there orter be writing 'bout a big thing
Title:  like this. And blood."
Title:  
Title:     Tom's whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;
Title:  the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it. He
Title:  picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a little
Title:  fragment of "red keel" out of his pocket, got the moon on his work, and
Title:  painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by
Title:  clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the
Title:  up-strokes. [See next page.]
Title:  
Title:     Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing, and
Title:  the sublimity of his language.
Title:  He at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but
Title:  Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on it."
Title:  
Title:     "What's verdigrease?"
Title:  
Title:     "It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it once --
Title:  you'll see."
Title:  
Title:     So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked
Title:  the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after many
Title:  squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using
Title:  the ball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to
Title:  make an H and an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close
Title:  to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters
Title:  that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown
Title:  away.
Title:  
Title:     A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined
Title:  building, now, but they did not notice it.
Title:  
Title:     "Tom," whispered Huckleberry, "does this keep us from ever telling --
Title:  always?"
Title:  
Title:     "Of course it does. It don't make any difference what happens, we got to
Title:  keep mum. We'd drop down dead -- don't you know that?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, I reckon that's so."
Title:  
Title:     They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up a
Title:  long, lugubrious howl just outside -- within ten feet of them. The boys
Title:  clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.
Title:  
Title:     "Which of us does he mean?" gasped Huckleberry.
Title:  
Title:     "I dono -- peep through the crack. Quick!"
Title:  
Title:     "No, you, Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     "I can't -- I can't do it, Huck!"
Title:  
Title:     "Please, Tom. There 'tis again!"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!" whispered Tom. "I know his voice. It's Bull
Title:  Harbison." *
Title:  
Title:  
Title:  Note: * If Mr. Harbison had owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken
Title:  of him as "Harbison's Bull," but a son or a dog of that name was "Bull
Title:  Harbison."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, that's good -- I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a
Title:  bet anything it was a stray dog."
Title:  
Title:     The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!" whispered Huckleberry. " Do ,
Title:  Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His
Title:  whisper was hardly audible when he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Huck, IT'S A STRAY DOG!"
Title:  
Title:     "Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?"
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, he must mean us both -- we're right together."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout
Title:  where I'll go to. I been so wicked."
Title:  
Title:     "Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
Title:  feller's told not to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a tried --
Title:  but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off this time, I lay I'll
Title:  just waller in Sunday-schools!" And Tom began to snuffle a little.
Title:  
Title:     " You bad!" and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. "Consound it, Tom
Title:  Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'longside o' what I am. Oh, lordy , lordy,
Title:  lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance."
Title:  
Title:     Tom choked off and whispered:
Title:  
Title:     "Look, Hucky, look! He's got his BACK to us!"
Title:  
Title:     Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.
Title:  
Title:     "Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you
Title:  know. Now who can he mean?"
Title:  
Title:     The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.
Title:  
Title:     "Sh! What's that?" he whispered.
Title:  
Title:     "Sounds like -- like hogs grunting. No -- it's somebody snoring, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "That is it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?"
Title:  
Title:     "I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep
Title:  there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts
Title:  things when he snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to this
Title:  town any more."
Title:  
Title:     The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.
Title:  
Title:     "Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"
Title:  
Title:     "I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
Title:  boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their
Title:  heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down, the
Title:  one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the snorer,
Title:  Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned,
Title:  writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter.
Title:  The boys' hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved,
Title:  but their fears passed away now. They
Title:  tiptoed out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little
Title:  distance to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the
Title:  night air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
Title:  feet of where Potter was lying, and facing Potter, with his nose pointing
Title:  heavenward.
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, geeminy, it's him!" exclaimed both boys, in a breath.
Title:  
Title:     "Say, Tom -- they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's
Title:  house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come in
Title:  and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there ain't
Title:  anybody dead there yet."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie Miller fall in
Title:  the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, but she ain't dead. And what's more, she's getting better, too."
Title:  
Title:     "All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure as Muff
Title:  Potter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they know all about these
Title:  kind of things, Huck."
Title:  
Title:     Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window
Title:  the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and fell
Title:  asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He was not
Title:  aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.
Title:  
Title:     When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone.
Title:  There was a late look in the light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was
Title:  startled. Why had he not been called -- persecuted till he was up, as usual?
Title:  The thought filled him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and
Title:  down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but
Title:  they had finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were
Title:  averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a
Title:  chill to the culprit's heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it was
Title:  up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence
Title:  and let his heart sink down to the depths.
Title:  
Title:     After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in the
Title:  hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt wept over
Title:  him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so; and finally
Title:  told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to
Title:  the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a
Title:  thousand whippings, and Tom's heart was sorer now than his body. He cried,
Title:  he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again, and then
Title:  received his dismissal, feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness
Title:  and established but a feeble confidence.
Title:  
Title:     He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid;
Title:  and so the latter's prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary. He
Title:  moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,
Title:  along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the air of
Title:  one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles. Then
Title:  he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in
Title:  his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has
Title:  reached the limit and can no further go. His elbow was pressing against some
Title:  hard substance. After a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position,
Title:  and took up this object with a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A
Title:  long, lingering, colossal sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his

Title:                                   Chapter XI
Title:  
Title:     CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
Title:  with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet undreamed-of telegraph; the
Title:  tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house, with
Title:  little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave holiday
Title:  for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of him if he had
Title:  not.
Title:  
Title:     A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been
Title:  recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter -- so the story ran. And
Title:  it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself in
Title:  the "branch" about one or two o'clock in the morning, and that Potter had at
Title:  once sneaked off -- suspicious circumstances, especially the washing which
Title:  was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had been
Title:  ransacked for this "murderer" (the public are not slow in the matter of
Title:  sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he could not be found.
Title:  Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction, and the Sheriff
Title:  "was confident" that he would be captured before night.
Title:  
Title:     All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom's heartbreak vanished
Title:  and he joined the procession, not because he would not a thousand times
Title:  rather go anywhere else, but because an awful, unaccountable fascination
Title:  drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he wormed his small body through
Title:  the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle. It seemed to him an age since he was
Title:  there before. Somebody pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met
Title:  Huckleberry's. Then both looked elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody
Title:  had noticed anything in their mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and
Title:  intent upon the grisly spectacle before them.
Title:  
Title:     "Poor fellow!" "Poor young fellow!" "This ought to be a lesson to grave
Title:  robbers!" "Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch him!" This was the
Title:  drift of remark; and the minister said, "It was a judgment; His hand is
Title:  here."
Title:  
Title:     Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid face
Title:  of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle, and
Title:  voices shouted, "It's him! it's him! he's coming himself!"
Title:  
Title:     "Who? Who?" from twenty voices.
Title:  
Title:     "Muff Potter!"
Title:  
Title:     "Hallo, he's stopped! -- Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get away!"
Title:  
Title:     People in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he wasn't trying
Title:  to get away -- he only looked doubtful and perplexed.
Title:  
Title:     "Infernal impudence!" said a bystander; "wanted to come and take a quiet
Title:  look at his work, I reckon -- didn't expect any company."
Title:  
Title:     The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously
Title:  leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow's face was haggard, and his eyes
Title:  showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the murdered man, he
Title:  shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands and burst into
Title:  tears.
Title:  
Title:     "I didn't do it, friends," he sobbed; "'pon my word and honor I never
Title:  done it."
Title:  
Title:     "Who's accused you?" shouted a voice.
Title:  
Title:     This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around
Title:  him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and
Title:  exclaimed:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Is that your knife?" and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.
Title:  
Title:     Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the
Title:  ground. Then he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get -- " He shuddered;
Title:  then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, "Tell 'em,
Title:  Joe, tell 'em -- it ain't any use any more."
Title:  
Title:     Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the
Title:  stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every
Title:  moment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon his head, and
Title:  wondering to see how long the stroke
Title:  was delayed. And when he had finished and still stood alive and whole, their
Title:  wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner's
Title:  life faded and vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to
Title:  Satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as
Title:  that.
Title:  
Title:     "Why didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for?" somebody
Title:  said.
Title:  
Title:     "I couldn't help it -- I couldn't help it," Potter moaned. "I wanted to
Title:  run away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here." And he fell to
Title:  sobbing again.
Title:  
Title:     Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes afterward
Title:  on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the lightnings were
Title:  still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that Joe had sold himself to
Title:  the devil. He was now become, to them, the most balefully interesting object
Title:  they had ever looked upon, and they could not take their fascinated eyes
Title:  from his face.
Title:  
Title:     They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should
Title:  offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.
Title:  
Title:     Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a
Title:  wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd that
Title:  the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy circumstance would
Title:  turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were disappointed, for more
Title:  than one villager remarked:
Title:  
Title:     "It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it."
Title:  
Title:     Tom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
Title:  much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
Title:  awake half the time."
Title:  
Title:     Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.
Title:  
Title:     "It's a bad sign," said Aunt Polly, gravely. "What you got on your mind,
Title:  Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "Nothing. Nothing 't I know of." But the boy's hand shook so that he
Title:  spilled his coffee.
Title:  
Title:     "And you do talk such stuff," Sid said. "Last night you said, 'It's
Title:  blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and over. And you
Title:  said, 'Don't torment me so -- I'll tell!' Tell what? What is it you'll
Title:  tell?"
Title:  
Title:     Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have
Title:  happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly's face and
Title:  she came to Tom's relief without knowing it. She said:
Title:  
Title:     "Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night
Title:  myself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it."
Title:  
Title:     Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.
Title:  Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after that
Title:  he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every night. He
Title:  never knew that Sid lay
Title:  nightly watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on
Title:  his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward slipped the
Title:  bandage back to its place again. Tom's distress of mind wore off gradually
Title:  and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to
Title:  make anything out of Tom's disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.
Title:  
Title:     It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
Title:  inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind. Sid
Title:  noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries, though it had
Title:  been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises; he noticed, too,
Title:  that Tom never acted as a witness -- and that was strange; and Sid did not
Title:  overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests,
Title:  and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled, but said nothing.
Title:  However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and ceased to torture
Title:  Tom's conscience.
Title:  
Title:     Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his opportunity
Title:  and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such small comforts
Title:  through to the "murderer" as he could get hold of. The jail was a trifling
Title:  little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village, and no
Title:  guards were afforded for it; indeed, it was seldom occupied. These offerings
Title:  greatly helped to ease Tom's conscience.
Title:  
Title:     The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather
Title:  Injun Joe and ride him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was
Title:  his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in
Title:  the matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his
Title:  inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery that
Title:  preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in the
Title:  courts at present.
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                   Chapter XII
Title:  
Title:     ONE of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret
Title:  troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself
Title:  about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had struggled with
Title:  his pride a few days, and tried to "whistle her down the wind," but failed.
Title:  He began to find himself hanging around her father's house, nights, and
Title:  feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she should die! There was
Title:  distraction in the thought. He no longer took an interest in war, nor even
Title:  in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness
Title:  left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any more.
Title:  His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of remedies on him. She
Title:  was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all
Title:  new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate
Title:  experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line came out she
Title:  was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never
Title:  ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was
Title:  a subscriber for all the "Health" periodicals and phrenological frauds; and
Title:  the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All
Title:  the "rot" they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to
Title:  get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take,
Title:  and what frame of mind to keep one's self in, and what sort of clothing to
Title:  wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals
Title:  of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the
Title:  month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was long, and
Title:  so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her quack periodicals and
Title:  her quack medicines, and thus armed with death, went about on her pale
Title:  horse, metaphorically speaking, with "hell following after." But she never
Title:  suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in
Title:  disguise, to the suffering neighbors.
Title:  
Title:     The water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was a windfall
Title:  to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the
Title:  wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed him
Title:  down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she rolled him up
Title:  in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul
Title:  clean and "the yellow stains of it came through his pores" -- as Tom said.
Title:  
Title:     Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and
Title:  pale and dejected. She
Title:  added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges. The boy remained as
Title:  dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet
Title:  and blister-plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a jug's, and
Title:  filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.
Title:  
Title:     Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase filled
Title:  the old lady's heart with consternation. This indifference must be broken up
Title:  at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first time. She ordered a
Title:  lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with gratitude. It was simply fire
Title:  in a liquid form. She dropped the water treatment and everything else, and
Title:  pinned her faith to Pain-killer. She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with
Title:  the deepest anxiety for the result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her
Title:  soul at peace again; for the "indifference" was broken up. The boy could not
Title:  have shown a wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.
Title:  
Title:     Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be romantic
Title:  enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have too little
Title:  sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he thought over
Title:  various plans for relief, and finally hit pon that of professing to be fond
Title:  of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he became a nuisance, and his
Title:  aunt ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her. If it had
Title:  been Sid, she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight;
Title:  but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle clandestinely. She found that
Title:  the medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her that the boy
Title:  was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room floor with it.
Title:  
Title:     One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's yellow cat
Title:  came along, purring, eying the teaspoon avariciously, and begging for a
Title:  taste. Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter."
Title:  
Title:     But Peter signified that he did want it.
Title:  
Title:     "You better make sure."
Title:  
Title:     Peter was sure.
Title:  
Title:     "Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't
Title:  anything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't blame
Title:  anybody but your own self."
Title:  
Title:     Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the
Title:  Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then delivered a
Title:  war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging against furniture,
Title:  upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next he rose on his hind
Title:  feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his
Title:  shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went
Title:  tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path.
Title:  Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver
Title:  a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the open
Title:  window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him. The old lady stood
Title:  petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor
Title:  expiring with laughter.
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, what on earth ails that cat?"
Title:  
Title:     "I don't know, aunt," gasped the boy.
Title:  
Title:     "Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?"
Title:  
Title:     "Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having a
Title:  good time."
Title:  
Title:     "They do, do they?" There was something in the tone that made Tom
Title:  apprehensive.
Title:  
Title:     "Yes'm. That is, I believe they do."
Title:  
Title:     "You do?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes'm."
Title:  
Title:     The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized by
Title:  anxiety. Too late he divined her "drift." The handle of the telltale
Title:  teaspoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it up.
Title:  Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle
Title:  -- his ear -- and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.
Title:  
Title:     "Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?"
Title:  
Title:     "I done it out of pity for him -- because he hadn't any aunt."
Title:  
Title:     "Hadn't any aunt! -- you numskull. What has that got to do with it?"
Title:  
Title:     "Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt
Title:  him out herself! She'd a roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more
Title:  feeling than if he was a human!"
Title:  
Title:     Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in a
Title:  new light; what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy, too. She
Title:  began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she put her
Title:  hand on Tom's head and said gently:
Title:  
Title:     "I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it did do you good."
Title:  
Title:     Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through
Title:  his gravity.
Title:  
Title:     "I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It
Title:  done him good, too. I never see him get around so since -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try
Title:  and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any more
Title:  medicine."
Title:  
Title:     Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing
Title:  had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late, he hung
Title:  about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades. He
Title:  was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to be looking
Title:  everywhere but whither he really was looking -- down the road. Presently
Title:  Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom's face lighted; he gazed a moment, and
Title:  then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and "led
Title:  up" warily to opportunities for remark
Title:  about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and
Title:  watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the
Title:  owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks
Title:  ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the
Title:  empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed in at
Title:  the gate, and Tom's heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out,
Title:  and "going on" like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over
Title:  the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings, standing on his
Title:  head -- doing all the heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a
Title:  furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But
Title:  she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be
Title:  possible that she was not aware that he was there? He carried his exploits
Title:  to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy's cap,
Title:  hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys,
Title:  tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's
Title:  nose, almost upsetting her -- and she turned, with her nose in the air, and
Title:  he heard her say: "Mf! some people think they're mighty smart -- always
Title:  showing off!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and
Title:  crestfallen.
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                  Chapter XIII
Title:  
Title:     TOM'S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a
Title:  forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out
Title:  what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried to do
Title:  right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing would do them
Title:  but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame him for the
Title:  consequences -- why shouldn't they? What right had the friendless to
Title:  complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would lead a life of
Title:  crime. There was no choice.
Title:  
Title:     By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to
Title:  "take up" tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he should
Title:  never, never hear that old familiar sound any more -- it was very hard, but
Title:  it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold world, he must
Title:  submit -- but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and fast.
Title:  
Title:     Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe Harper --
Title:  hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart.
Title:  Plainly here were
Title:  "two souls with but a single thought." Tom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve,
Title:  began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage
Title:  and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to
Title:  return; and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him.
Title:  
Title:     But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going
Title:  to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother had
Title:  whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew
Title:  nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go;
Title:  if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped
Title:  she would be happy, and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the
Title:  unfeeling world to suffer and die.
Title:  
Title:     As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand
Title:  by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of
Title:  their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for being a
Title:  hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying, some time, of cold
Title:  and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he conceded that there were
Title:  some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime, and so he consented to be
Title:  a pirate.
Title:  
Title:     Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River
Title:  was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with
Title:  a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well
Title:  as a rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further
Title:  shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson's
Title:  Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
Title:  matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn, and
Title:  he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was
Title:  indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the
Title:  river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour -- which was
Title:  midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture. Each
Title:  would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal in the
Title:  most dark and mysterious way -- as became outlaws. And before the afternoon
Title:  was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the
Title:  fact that pretty soon the town would "hear something." All who got this
Title:  vague hint were cautioned to "be mum and wait."
Title:  
Title:     About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles, and
Title:  stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
Title:  meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay like
Title:  an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the quiet.
Title:  Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under the bluff.
Title:  Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the same way. Then a
Title:  guarded voice said:
Title:  
Title:     "Who goes there?"
Title:  
Title:     "Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names."
Title:  
Title:     "Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas." Tom
Title:  had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.
Title:  
Title:     "'Tis well. Give the countersign."
Title:  
Title:     Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
Title:  brooding night:
Title:  
Title:     "BLOOD!"
Title:  
Title:     Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
Title:  tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was an
Title:  easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked the
Title:  advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.
Title:  
Title:     The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn
Title:  himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a skillet
Title:  and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought a few
Title:  corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or "chewed" but
Title:  himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it would never do to
Title:  start without some fire. That was a wise thought; matches were hardly known
Title:  there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred
Title:  yards above, and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a
Title:  chunk. They made an imposing adventure of it, saying, "Hist!" every now and
Title:  then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on
Title:  imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if "the
Title:  foe" stirred, to "let him have it to the hilt," because "dead men tell no
Title:  tales." They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village
Title:  laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their
Title:  conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.
Title:  
Title:     They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and Joe
Title:  at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded arms,
Title:  and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:
Title:  
Title:     "Luff, and bring her to the wind!"
Title:  
Title:     "Aye-aye, sir!"
Title:  
Title:     "Steady, steady-y-y-y!"
Title:  
Title:     "Steady it is, sir!"
Title:  
Title:     "Let her go off a point!"
Title:  
Title:     "Point it is, sir!"
Title:  
Title:     As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream it
Title:  was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for "style," and
Title:  were not intended to mean anything in particular.
Title:  
Title:     "What sail's she carrying?"
Title:  
Title:     "Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir."
Title:  
Title:     "Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of ye --
Title:  foretopmaststuns'l! Lively, now!"
Title:  
Title:     "Aye-aye, sir!"
Title:  
Title:     "Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! Now my hearties!"
Title:  
Title:     "Aye-aye, sir!"
Title:  
Title:     "Hellum-a-lee -- hard a port! Stand by to meet
Title:  her when she comes! Port, port! Now, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!"
Title:  
Title:     "Steady it is, sir!"
Title:  
Title:     The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head
Title:  right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was not
Title:  more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during the
Title:  next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the distant
Title:  town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully
Title:  sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of
Title:  the tremendous event that was happening. The Black Avenger stood still with
Title:  folded arms, "looking his last" upon the scene of his former joys and his
Title:  later sufferings, and wishing "she" could see him now, abroad on the wild
Title:  sea, facing peril and death with dauntless heart, going to his doom with a
Title:  grim smile on his lips. It was but a small strain on his imagination to
Title:  remove Jackson's Island beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he "looked
Title:  his last" with a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking
Title:  their last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the
Title:  current drift them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the
Title:  danger in time, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning
Title:  the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,
Title:  and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part of
Title:  the little
Title:  raft's belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook
Title:  in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves
Title:  would sleep in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.
Title:  
Title:     They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
Title:  within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in the
Title:  frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn "pone" stock they had
Title:  brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild, free way in
Title:  the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island, far from the
Title:  haunts of men, and they said they never would return to civilization. The
Title:  climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared
Title:  tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the varnished foliage and
Title:  festooning vines.
Title:  
Title:     When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of
Title:  corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass, filled
Title:  with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but they would not
Title:  deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting camp-fire.
Title:  
Title:     "AIN'T it gay?" said Joe.
Title:  
Title:     "It's NUTS!" said Tom. "What would the boys say if they could see us?"
Title:  
Title:     "Say? Well, they'd just die to be here -- hey, Hucky!"
Title:  
Title:     "I reckon so," said Huckleberry; "anyways,
Title:  I'm suited. I don't want nothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to
Title:  eat, gen'ally -- and here they can't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag
Title:  him so."
Title:  
Title:     "It's just the life for me," said Tom. "You don't have to get up,
Title:  mornings, and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all that blame
Title:  foolishness. You see a pirate don't have to do anything, Joe, when he's
Title:  ashore, but a hermit he has to be praying considerable, and then he don't
Title:  have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh yes, that's so," said Joe, "but I hadn't thought much about it, you
Title:  know. I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it."
Title:  
Title:     "You see," said Tom, "people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like
Title:  they used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected. And a hermit's
Title:  got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put sackcloth and ashes
Title:  on his head, and stand out in the rain, and -- "
Title:  
Title:     "What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?" inquired Huck.
Title:  
Title:     " I dono. But they've got to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have to do
Title:  that if you was a hermit."
Title:  
Title:     "Dern'd if I would," said Huck.
Title:  
Title:     "Well, what would you do?"
Title:  
Title:     "I dono. But I wouldn't do that."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, Huck, you'd have to. How'd you get around it?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away."
Title:  
Title:     "Run away! Well, you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You'd be a
Title:  disgrace."
Title:  
Title:     The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished
Title:  gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with
Title:  tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of
Title:  fragrant smoke -- he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The
Title:  other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to
Title:  acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:
Title:  
Title:     "What does pirates have to do?"
Title:  
Title:     Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, they have just a bully time -- take ships and burn them, and get the
Title:  money and bury it in awful places in their island where there's ghosts and
Title:  things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships -- make 'em walk a
Title:  plank."
Title:  
Title:     "And they carry the women to the island," said Joe; "they don't kill the
Title:  women."
Title:  
Title:     "No," assented Tom, "they don't kill the women -- they're too noble. And
Title:  the women's always beautiful, too.
Title:  
Title:     "And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver and
Title:  di'monds," said Joe, with enthusiasm.
Title:  
Title:     "Who?" said Huck.
Title:  
Title:     "Why, the pirates."
Title:  
Title:     Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.
Title:  
Title:     "I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate," said
Title:  he, with a regretful pathos in his voice; "but I ain't got none but these."
Title:  
Title:     But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,
Title:  after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand that
Title:  his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy
Title:  pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.
Title:  
Title:     Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
Title:  eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the
Title:  Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary. The
Title:  Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more
Title:  difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly, and lying
Title:  down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and
Title:  recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all, but they
Title:  were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a
Title:  sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once they reached and
Title:  hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep -- but an intruder came, now, that
Title:  would not "down." It was conscience. They began to feel a vague fear that
Title:  they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen
Title:  meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to argue it away by
Title:  reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of
Title:  times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin
Title:  plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting
Title:  around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only "hooking," while
Title:  taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing -- and
Title:  there was a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved
Title:  that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should not
Title:  again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a
Title:  truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.

Title:                                   Chapter XIV
Title:  
Title:     WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and
Title:  rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool
Title:  gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep
Title:  pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not a sound
Title:  obtruded upon great Nature's meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood upon the
Title:  leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire, and a thin blue
Title:  breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck still slept.
Title:  
Title:     Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently the
Title:  hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray of the
Title:  morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested
Title:  itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded
Title:  itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came crawling over a dewy
Title:  leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and
Title:  "sniffing around," then proceeding again -- for he was measuring, Tom said;
Title:  and when the worm approached
Title:  him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising
Title:  and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed
Title:  inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment
Title:  with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg
Title:  and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad -- for that meant
Title:  that he was going to have a new suit of clothes -- without the shadow of a
Title:  doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from
Title:  nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully
Title:  by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it
Title:  straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height
Title:  of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, "Lady-bug,
Title:  lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children's alone," and
Title:  she took wing and went off to see about it -- which did not surprise the
Title:  boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations,
Title:  and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came
Title:  next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it
Title:  shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly
Title:  rioting by this time. A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over
Title:  Tom's head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of
Title:  enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped
Title:  on a twig almost within the boy's
Title:  reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming
Title:  curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the "fox" kind came skurrying
Title:  along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the
Title:  wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew
Title:  whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now;
Title:  long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near,
Title:  and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.
Title:  
Title:     Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a
Title:  shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling
Title:  over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar. They felt
Title:  no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the
Title:  majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had
Title:  carried off their raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was
Title:  something like burning the bridge between them and civilization.
Title:  
Title:     They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous;
Title:  and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a spring of
Title:  clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory
Title:  leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that,
Title:  would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe was slicing bacon
Title:  for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a
Title:  promising nook in the river-bank and threw in their
Title:  lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time to get
Title:  impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass, a couple of
Title:  sun-perch and a small catfish -- provisions enough for quite a family. They
Title:  fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had ever
Title:  seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the quicker a fresh-water
Title:  fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they reflected
Title:  little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and
Title:  a large ingredient of hunger make, too.
Title:  
Title:     They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,
Title:  and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They tramped
Title:  gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush, among solemn
Title:  monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping
Title:  regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with
Title:  grass and jeweled with flowers.
Title:  
Title:     They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be
Title:  astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles long
Title:  and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to was only
Title:  separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide. They
Title:  took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle of the
Title:  afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to stop to fish,
Title:  but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw themselves down in the
Title:  shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag, and then died. The
Title:  stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods, and the sense of
Title:  loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys. They fell to
Title:  thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This took dim shape,
Title:  presently -- it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the Red-Handed was
Title:  dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they were all ashamed of
Title:  their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak his thought.
Title:  
Title:     For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound
Title:  in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he
Title:  takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound became more
Title:  pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started, glanced at each
Title:  other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There was a long silence,
Title:  profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of
Title:  the distance.
Title:  
Title:     "What is it!" exclaimed Joe, under his breath.
Title:  
Title:     "I wonder," said Tom in a whisper.
Title:  
Title:     "'Tain't thunder," said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, "becuz thunder -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Hark!" said Tom. "Listen -- don't talk."
Title:  
Title:     They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom
Title:  troubled the solemn hush.
Title:  
Title:     "Let's go and see."
Title:  
Title:     They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They
Title:  parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little
Title:  steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the
Title:  current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great many
Title:  skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the
Title:  ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing.
Title:  Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat's side, and as
Title:  it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull throb of sound was
Title:  borne to the listeners again.
Title:  
Title:     "I know now!" exclaimed Tom; "somebody's drownded!"
Title:  
Title:     "That's it!" said Huck; "they done that last summer, when Bill Turner got
Title:  drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes him come up to
Title:  the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in 'em and
Title:  set 'em afloat, and wherever there's anybody that's drownded, they'll float
Title:  right there and stop."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, I've heard about that," said Joe. "I wonder what makes the bread do
Title:  that."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, it ain't the bread, so much," said Tom; "I reckon it's mostly what
Title:  they SAY over it before they start it out."
Title:  
Title:     "But they don't say anything over it," said Huck. "I've seen 'em and they
Title:  don't."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, that's funny," said Tom. "But maybe
Title:  they say it to themselves. Of course they do. Anybody might know that."
Title:  
Title:     The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because an
Title:  ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be
Title:  expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity.
Title:  
Title:     "By jings, I wish I was over there, now," said Joe.
Title:  
Title:     "I do too" said Huck "I'd give heaps to know who it is."
Title:  
Title:     The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought
Title:  flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:
Title:  
Title:     "Boys, I know who's drownded -- it's us!"
Title:  
Title:     They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they
Title:  were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account; tears
Title:  were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads
Title:  were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and
Title:  best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of
Title:  all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned. This was
Title:  fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.
Title:  
Title:     As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business
Title:  and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were jubilant
Title:  with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were
Title:  making. They caught fish,
Title:  cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village was
Title:  thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of the public
Title:  distress on their account were gratifying to look upon -- from their point
Title:  of view. But when the shadows of night closed them in, they gradually ceased
Title:  to talk, and sat gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering
Title:  elsewhere. The excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back
Title:  thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic
Title:  as much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a
Title:  sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a
Title:  roundabout "feeler" as to how the others might look upon a return to
Title:  civilization -- not right now, but --
Title:  
Title:     Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined in
Title:  with Tom, and the waverer quickly "explained," and was glad to get out of
Title:  the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness clinging to
Title:  his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the
Title:  moment.
Title:  
Title:     As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore. Joe
Title:  followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time, watching
Title:  the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees, and went
Title:  searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung by the
Title:  camp-fire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders
Title:  of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed to
Title:  suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon each
Title:  of these with his "red keel"; one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket,
Title:  and the other he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a little distance from
Title:  the owner. And he also put into the hat certain schoolboy treasures of
Title:  almost inestimable value -- among them a lump of chalk, an India-rubber
Title:  ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind of marbles known as a "sure
Title:  'nough crystal." Then he tiptoed his way cautiously among the trees till he
Title:  felt that he was out of hearing, and straightway broke into a keen run in
Title:  the direction of the sandbar.
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                   Chapter XV
Title:  
Title:     A FEW minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward
Title:  the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was half-way
Title:  over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out
Title:  confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering
Title:  upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected.
Title:  However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low
Title:  place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his
Title:  piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods, following the shore,
Title:  with streaming garments. Shortly before ten o'clock he came out into an open
Title:  place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the
Title:  trees and the high bank. Everything was quiet under the blinking stars. He
Title:  crept down the bank, watching with all his eyes, slipped into the water,
Title:  swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did "yawl" duty
Title:  at the boat's stern. He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited,
Title:  panting.
Title:  
Title:     Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to "cast
Title:  off." A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up, against
Title:  the boat's swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in his success,
Title:  for he knew it was the boat's last trip for the night. At the end of a long
Title:  twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and
Title:  swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of
Title:  possible stragglers.
Title:  
Title:     He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
Title:  aunt's back fence. He climbed over, approached the "ell," and looked in at
Title:  the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There sat Aunt
Title:  Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother, grouped together, talking. They
Title:  were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the door. Tom went to the
Title:  door and began to softly lift the latch; then he pressed gently and the door
Title:  yielded a crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every time it
Title:  creaked, till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees; so he put his
Title:  head through and began, warily.
Title:  
Title:     "What makes the candle blow so?" said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. "Why,
Title:  that door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange things
Title:  now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid."
Title:  
Title:     Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and "breathed" himself
Title:  for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunt's foot.
Title:  
Title:     "But as I was saying," said Aunt Polly, "he warn't bad, so to say -- only
Title:  mischeevous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't any more
Title:  responsible than a colt. He never meant any harm, and he was the
Title:  best-hearted boy that ever was" -- and she began to cry.
Title:  
Title:     "It was just so with my Joe -- always full of his devilment, and up to
Title:  every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be
Title:  -- and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream,
Title:  never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour,
Title:  and I never to see him again in this world, never, never, never, poor abused
Title:  boy!" And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would break.
Title:  
Title:     "I hope Tom's better off where he is," said Sid, "but if he'd been better
Title:  in some ways -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Sid !" Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could not see
Title:  it. "Not a word against my Tom, now that he's gone! God'll take care of him
Title:  -- never you trouble yourself, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don't know how to
Title:  give him up! I don't know how to give him up! He was such a comfort to me,
Title:  although he tormented my old heart out of me, 'most."
Title:  
Title:     "The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away -- Blessed be the name of
Title:  the Lord! But it's so hard -- Oh, it's so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe
Title:  busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling. Little
Title:  did I know then,
Title:  how soon -- Oh, if it was to do over again I'd hug him and bless him for
Title:  it."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just
Title:  exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took and
Title:  filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would tear
Title:  the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my thimble,
Title:  poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out of all his troubles now. And the last
Title:  words I ever heard him say was to reproach -- "
Title:  
Title:     But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely
Title:  down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself -- and more in pity of himself than
Title:  anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word for
Title:  him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself than
Title:  ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief to long
Title:  to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy -- and the
Title:  theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature, too,
Title:  but he resisted and lay still.
Title:  
Title:     He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was
Title:  conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim; then
Title:  the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing lads had
Title:  promised that the village should "hear something" soon; the wise-heads had
Title:  "put this and that together" and decided that the lads had gone off on that
Title:  raft and would turn up at the
Title:  next town below, presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged
Title:  against the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village -- and
Title:  then hope perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them
Title:  home by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the
Title:  bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have
Title:  occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would
Title:  otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies
Title:  continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the
Title:  funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.
Title:  
Title:     Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing good-night and turned to go. Then with a
Title:  mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's
Title:  arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was tender
Title:  far beyond her wont, in her good-night to Sid and Mary. Sid snuffled a bit
Title:  and Mary went off crying with all her heart.
Title:  
Title:     Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,
Title:  and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,
Title:  that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.
Title:  
Title:     He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making
Title:  broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and
Title:  turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a
Title:  little in her sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside,
Title:  shaded the candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart
Title:  was full of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by
Title:  the candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering. His
Title:  face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark hastily
Title:  in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and straightway
Title:  made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.
Title:  
Title:     He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large
Title:  there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was tenantless
Title:  except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and slept like a
Title:  graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped into it, and was
Title:  soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a mile above the
Title:  village, he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work.
Title:  He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for this was a familiar bit of
Title:  work to him. He was moved to capture the skiff, arguing that it might be
Title:  considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a
Title:  thorough search would be made for it and that might end in revelations. So
Title:  he stepped ashore and entered the woods.
Title:  
Title:     He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep
Title:  awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far
Title:  spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly
Title:  abreast the island bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and
Title:  gilding the great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the
Title:  stream. A little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp,
Title:  and heard Joe say:
Title:  
Title:     "No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't desert. He
Title:  knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's too proud for that
Title:  sort of thing. He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?"
Title:  
Title:     "Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain't
Title:  back here to breakfast."
Title:  
Title:     "Which he is!" exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping grandly
Title:  into camp.
Title:  
Title:     A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the
Title:  boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures. They
Title:  were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done. Then Tom
Title:  hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the other pirates
Title:  got ready to fish and explore.

Title:                                   Chapter XVI
Title:  
Title:     AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.
Title:  They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft
Title:  place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes they
Title:  would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly round
Title:  white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a famous
Title:  fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.
Title:  
Title:     After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and
Title:  chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they
Title:  were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the
Title:  bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under
Title:  them from time to time and greatly increased the fun. And now and then they
Title:  stooped in a group and splashed water in each other's faces with their
Title:  palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the
Title:  strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man
Title:  ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under
Title:  in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering,
Title:  laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.
Title:  
Title:     When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,
Title:  hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by break
Title:  for the water again and go through the original performance once more.
Title:  Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored
Title:  "tights" very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus --
Title:  with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest post to his
Title:  neighbor.
Title:  
Title:     Next they got their marbles and played "knucks" and "ring-taw" and
Title:  "keeps" till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another swim,
Title:  but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off his trousers
Title:  he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle, and he
Title:  wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this
Title:  mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he had found it, and by
Title:  that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest. They gradually
Title:  wandered apart, dropped into the "dumps," and fell to gazing longingly
Title:  across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun. Tom
Title:  found himself writing "BECKY" in the sand with his big toe; he scratched it
Title:  out, and was angry with himself for his weakness. But he wrote it again,
Title:  nevertheless; he could not help it. He erased it once more and then took
Title:  himself out of
Title:  temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them.
Title:  
Title:     But Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so
Title:  homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay very
Title:  near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was down-hearted, but tried
Title:  hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready to tell, yet,
Title:  but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he would have to
Title:  bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:
Title:  
Title:     "I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore it
Title:  again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you feel to light on a
Title:  rotten chest full of gold and silver -- hey?"
Title:  
Title:     But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply. Tom
Title:  tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was discouraging
Title:  work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy.
Title:  Finally he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so lonesome."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by," said Tom. "Just think of the
Title:  fishing that's here."
Title:  
Title:     "I don't care for fishing. I want to go home."
Title:  
Title:     "But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place anywhere."
Title:  
Title:     "Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when there
Title:  ain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, I do want to see my mother -- and you would, too, if you had one. I
Title:  ain't any more baby than you are." And Joe snuffled a little.
Title:  
Title:     "Well, we'll let the cry-baby go home to his mother, won't we, Huck? Poor
Title:  thing -- does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,
Title:  don't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't we?"
Title:  
Title:     Huck said, "Y-e-s" -- without any heart in it.
Title:  
Title:     "I'll never speak to you again as long as I live," said Joe, rising.
Title:  "There now!" And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.
Title:  
Title:     "Who cares!" said Tom. "Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get
Title:  laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't cry-babies. We'll
Title:  stay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along
Title:  without him, per'aps."
Title:  
Title:     But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly
Title:  on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying Joe's
Title:  preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.
Title:  Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois
Title:  shore. Tom's heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck could not bear
Title:  the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:
Title:  
Title:     "I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now it'll
Title:  be worse. Let's us go, too, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, I better go."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, go 'long -- who's hendering you."
Title:  
Title:     Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll wait for you
Title:  when we get to shore."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all."
Title:  
Title:     Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a
Title:  strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too. He
Title:  hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It suddenly
Title:  dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made one final
Title:  struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades, yelling:
Title:  
Title:     "Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!"
Title:  
Title:     They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they were,
Title:  he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at last they
Title:  saw the "point" he was driving at, and then they set up a war-whoop of
Title:  applause and said it was "splendid!" and said if he had told them at first,
Title:  they wouldn't have started away. He made a plausible excuse; but his real
Title:  reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him
Title:  any very great length of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as
Title:  a last seduction.
Title:  
Title:     The lads came gayly back and went at their sports
Title:  again with a will, chattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and
Title:  admiring the genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he
Title:  wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like
Title:  to try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never
Title:  smoked anything before but cigars made of grape-vine, and they "bit" the
Title:  tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.
Title:  
Title:     Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,
Title:  charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste, and
Title:  they gagged a little, but Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a learnt long
Title:  ago."
Title:  
Title:     "So would I," said Joe. "It's just nothing."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish
Title:  I could do that; but I never thought I could," said Tom.
Title:  
Title:     "That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me talk just
Title:  that way -- haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I haven't."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes -- heaps of times," said Huck.
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I have too," said Tom; "oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the
Title:  slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and Johnny
Title:  Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't you remember, Huck, 'bout
Title:  me saying that?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, that's so," said Huck. "That was the
Title:  day after I lost a white alley. No, 'twas the day before."
Title:  
Title:     "There -- I told you so," said Tom. "Huck recollects it."
Title:  
Title:     "I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day," said Joe. "I don't feel
Title:  sick."
Title:  
Title:     "Neither do I," said Tom. " I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff
Title:  Thatcher couldn't."
Title:  
Title:     "Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him try
Title:  it once. He'd see!"
Title:  
Title:     "I bet he would. And Johnny Miller -- I wish could see Johnny Miller
Title:  tackle it once."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, don't I!" said Joe. "Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any more
Title:  do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch him ."
Title:  
Title:     "'Deed it would, Joe. Say -- I wish the boys could see us now."
Title:  
Title:     "So do I."
Title:  
Title:     "Say -- boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when they're
Title:  around, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.' And
Title:  you'll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn't anything, you'll say,
Title:  'Yes, I got my old pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain't very good.'
Title:  And I'll say, 'Oh, that's all right, if it's strong enough.' And then you'll
Title:  out with the pipes, and we'll light up just as ca'm, and then just see 'em
Title:  look!"
Title:  
Title:     "By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was now!"
Title:  
Title:     "So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating, won't
Title:  they wish they'd been along?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, I reckon not! I'll just bet they will!"
Title:  
Title:     So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow
Title:  disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously increased.
Title:  Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became a spouting fountain; they could
Title:  scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an
Title:  inundation; little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all
Title:  they could do, and sudden retchings followed every time. Both boys were
Title:  looking very pale and miserable, now. Joe's pipe dropped from his nerveless
Title:  fingers. Tom's followed. Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps
Title:  bailing with might and main. Joe said feebly:
Title:  
Title:     "I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it."
Title:  
Title:     Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:
Title:  
Title:     "I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring.
Title:  No, you needn't come, Huck -- we can find it."
Title:  
Title:     So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,
Title:  and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both very
Title:  pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had had any
Title:  trouble they had got rid of it.
Title:  
Title:     They were not talkative at supper that night.
Title:  They had a humble look, and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and
Title:  was going to prepare theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well
Title:  -- something they ate at dinner had disagreed with them.
Title:  
Title:     About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding
Title:  oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys huddled
Title:  themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire,
Title:  though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling. They
Title:  sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light
Title:  of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness.
Title:  Presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for
Title:  a moment and then vanished. By and by another came, a little stronger. Then
Title:  another. Then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest
Title:  and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with
Title:  the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a
Title:  weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grass-blade,
Title:  separate and distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three
Title:  white, startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling
Title:  down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A
Title:  sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky
Title:  ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the forest and
Title:  an instant crash followed that seemed to rend
Title:  the tree-tops right over the boys' heads. They clung together in terror, in
Title:  the thick gloom that followed. A few big rain-drops fell pattering upon the
Title:  leaves.
Title:  
Title:     "Quick! boys, go for the tent!" exclaimed Tom.
Title:  
Title:     They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no
Title:  two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through the
Title:  trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after another
Title:  came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching rain poured
Title:  down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The boys
Title:  cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the booming thunder-blasts
Title:  drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one they straggled in at last
Title:  and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but
Title:  to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could
Title:  not talk, the old sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would
Title:  have allowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the
Title:  sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The
Title:  boys seized each others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to
Title:  the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river-bank. Now the battle
Title:  was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that
Title:  flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in clean-cut and shadowless
Title:  distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy
Title:  river, white with foam, the driving spray of spume-flakes, the dim outlines
Title:  of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting
Title:  cloud-rack and the slanting veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree
Title:  yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the
Title:  unflagging thunder-peals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen
Title:  and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless
Title:  effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it
Title:  to the tree-tops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one
Title:  and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out
Title:  in.
Title:  
Title:     But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and
Title:  weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The boys
Title:  went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still
Title:  something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of
Title:  their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were not
Title:  under it when the catastrophe happened.
Title:  
Title:     Everything in camp was drenched, the camp-fire as well; for they were but
Title:  heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against
Title:  rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled.
Title:  They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the
Title:  fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been
Title:  built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground),
Title:  that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently
Title:  wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of
Title:  sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on great
Title:  dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were glad-hearted once
Title:  more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat
Title:  by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until
Title:  morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.
Title:  
Title:     As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over them,
Title:  and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got scorched
Title:  out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After the meal they
Title:  felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little home-sick once more. Tom saw the
Title:  signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could. But they
Title:  cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or anything. He reminded
Title:  them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, he
Title:  got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being pirates,
Title:  for a while, and be Indians for a change. They were attracted by this idea;
Title:  so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel
Title:  with black mud, like so many zebras -- all of them chiefs, of course -- and
Title:  then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.
Title:  
Title:     By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each
Title:  other from ambush with dreadful war-whoops, and killed and scalped each
Title:  other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely
Title:  satisfactory one.
Title:  
Title:     They assembled in camp toward supper-time, hungry and happy; but now a
Title:  difficulty arose -- hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality
Title:  together without first making peace, and this was a simple impossibility
Title:  without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other process that ever they
Title:  had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates.
Title:  However, there was no other way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they
Title:  could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed, in
Title:  due form.
Title:  
Title:     And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had
Title:  gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without
Title:  having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be
Title:  seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high promise
Title:  for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper, with right
Title:  fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were prouder and
Title:  happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping
Title:  and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to smoke and chatter and
Title:  brag, since we have no further use for them at present.

Title:                                  Chapter XVII
Title:  
Title:     BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday
Title:  afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly's family, were being put into
Title:  mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed the
Title:  village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience. The
Title:  villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked little;
Title:  but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children.
Title:  They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them up.
Title:  
Title:     In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted
Title:  schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing there
Title:  to comfort her. She soliloquized:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got anything
Title:  now to remember him by." And she choked back a little sob.
Title:  
Title:     Presently she stopped, and said to herself:
Title:  
Title:     "It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't say that
Title:  -- I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone now; I'll never,
Title:  never, never see him any more."
Title:  
Title:     This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling
Title:  down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls -- playmates of Tom's
Title:  and Joe's -- came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in
Title:  reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw him, and how
Title:  Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful prophecy, as they
Title:  could easily see now!) -- and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where
Title:  the lost lads stood at the time, and then added something like "and I was
Title:  a-standing just so -- just as I am now, and as if you was him -- I was as
Title:  close as that -- and he smiled, just this way -- and then something seemed
Title:  to go all over me, like -- awful, you know -- and I never thought what it
Title:  meant, of course, but I can see now!"
Title:  
Title:     Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and
Title:  many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or less
Title:  tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided who DID see
Title:  the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them, the lucky parties
Title:  took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and were gaped at and
Title:  envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had no other grandeur to offer,
Title:  said with tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once."
Title:  
Title:     But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,
Title:  and so that cheapened the
Title:  distinction too much. The group loitered away, still recalling memories of
Title:  the lost heroes, in awed voices.
Title:  
Title:     When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell
Title:  began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still
Title:  Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that
Title:  lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment in the
Title:  vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there was no
Title:  whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women
Title:  gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None could remember
Title:  when the little church had been so full before. There was finally a waiting
Title:  pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly entered, followed by Sid
Title:  and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in deep black, and the whole
Title:  congregation, the old minister as well, rose reverently and stood until the
Title:  mourners were seated in the front pew. There was another communing silence,
Title:  broken at intervals by muffled sobs, and then the minister spread his hands
Title:  abroad and prayed. A moving hymn was sung, and the text followed: "I am the
Title:  Resurrection and the Life."
Title:  
Title:     As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces,
Title:  the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that every soul
Title:  there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang in remembering
Title:  that he had persistently blinded
Title:  himself to them always before, and had as persistently seen only faults and
Title:  flaws in the poor boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the
Title:  lives of the departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures,
Title:  and the people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes
Title:  were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
Title:  seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation
Title:  became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last the
Title:  whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of
Title:  anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and crying
Title:  in the pulpit.
Title:  
Title:     There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later
Title:  the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above his
Title:  handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair of eyes
Title:  followed the minister's, and then almost with one impulse the congregation
Title:  rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle, Tom in
Title:  the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags, sneaking sheepishly
Title:  in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own
Title:  funeral sermon!
Title:  
Title:     Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored
Title:  ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while poor
Title:  Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what to do or
Title:  where to hide from so many
Title:  unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and started to slink away, but Tom seized him
Title:  and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck."
Title:  
Title:     "And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!" And the
Title:  loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of
Title:  making him more uncomfortable than he was before.
Title:  
Title:     Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: "Praise God from
Title:  whom all blessings flow -- SING! -- and put your hearts in it!"
Title:  
Title:     And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and while
Title:  it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the envying
Title:  juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest
Title:  moment of his life.
Title:  
Title:     As the "sold" congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
Title:  willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that once
Title:  more.
Title:  
Title:     Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day -- according to Aunt Polly's
Title:  varying moods -- than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew
Title:  which expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.
Title:

Title:  
Title:                                  Chapter XVIII
Title:  
Title:     THAT was Tom's great secret -- the scheme to return home with his brother
Title:  pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the Missouri
Title:  shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles below the
Title:  village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly
Title:  daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished
Title:  their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches.
Title:  
Title:     At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to
Title:  Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of talk.
Title:  In the course of it Aunt Polly said:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody
Title:  suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you
Title:  could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over on a
Title:  log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a hint some
Title:  way that you warn't dead, but only run off."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, you could have done that, Tom," said Mary; "and I believe you would
Title:  if you had thought of it."
Title:  
Title:     "Would you, Tom?" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. "Say, now,
Title:  would you, if you'd thought of it?"
Title:  
Title:     "I -- well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, I hoped you loved me that much," said Aunt Polly, with a grieved
Title:  tone that discomforted the boy. "It would have been something if you'd cared
Title:  enough to think of it, even if you didn't do it."
Title:  
Title:     "Now, auntie, that ain't any harm," pleaded Mary; "it's only Tom's giddy
Title:  way -- he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything."
Title:  
Title:     "More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and
Title:  done it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late, and wish
Title:  you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little."
Title:  
Title:     "Now, auntie, you know I do care for you," said Tom.
Title:  
Title:     "I'd know it better if you acted more like it."
Title:  
Title:     "I wish now I'd thought," said Tom, with a repentant tone; "but I dreamt
Title:  about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?"
Title:  
Title:     "It ain't much -- a cat does that much -- but it's better than nothing.
Title:  What did you dream?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
Title:  bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad
Title:  your dreams could take even that much trouble about us."
Title:  
Title:     "And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, try to recollect -- can't you?"
Title:  
Title:     "Somehow it seems to me that the wind -- the wind blowed the -- the -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then said:
Title:  
Title:     "I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!"
Title:  
Title:     "Mercy on us! Go on, Tom -- go on!"
Title:  
Title:     "And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door -- '"
Title:  
Title:     "Go on, Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     "Just let me study a moment -- just a moment. Oh, yes -- you said you
Title:  believed the door was open."
Title:  
Title:     "As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!"
Title:  
Title:     "And then -- and then -- well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if
Title:  you made Sid go and -- and -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?"
Title:  
Title:     "You made him -- you -- Oh, you made him shut it."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my
Title:  days! Don't tell me there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny Harper
Title:  shall know of this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her get around
Title:  this with her rubbage 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn't
Title:  bad, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible than --
Title:  than -- I think it was a colt, or something."
Title:  
Title:     "And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     "And then you began to cry."
Title:  
Title:     "So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and
Title:  she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd throwed it out
Title:  her own self -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying -- that's what you
Title:  was doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     "Then Sid he said -- he said -- "
Title:  
Title:     "I don't think I said anything," said Sid.
Title:  
Title:     "Yes you did, Sid," said Mary.
Title:  
Title:     "Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "He said -- I think he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone
Title:  to, but if I'd been better sometimes -- "
Title:  
Title:     "There, d'you hear that! It was his very words!"
Title:  
Title:     "And you shut him up sharp."
Title:  
Title:     "I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There was an angel
Title:  there, somewheres!"
Title:  
Title:     "And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you
Title:  told about Peter and the Painkiller -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Just as true as I live!"
Title:  
Title:     "And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for us,
Title:  and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged
Title:  and cried, and she went."
Title:  
Title:     "It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in
Title:  these very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a' seen it!
Title:  And then what? Go on, Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     "Then I thought you prayed for me -- and I could see you and hear every
Title:  word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote
Title:  on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead -- we are only off being
Title:  pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked so
Title:  good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed
Title:  you on the lips."
Title:  
Title:     "Did you, Tom, did you! I just forgive you everything for that!" And she
Title:  seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest
Title:  of villains.
Title:  
Title:     "It was very kind, even though it was only a -- dream," Sid soliloquized
Title:  just audibly.
Title:  
Title:     "Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he was
Title:  awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if you was
Title:  ever found again -- now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the good God and
Title:  Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering and merciful to
Title:  them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness knows I'm
Title:  unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His
Title:  hand to help them over the rough places, there's few enough would smile here
Title:  or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary,
Title:  Tom -- take yourselves off -- you've hendered me long enough."
Title:  
Title:     The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper and
Title:  vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid had better judgment
Title:  than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house. It was
Title:  this: "Pretty thin -- as long a dream as that, without any mistakes in it!"
Title:  
Title:     What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing, but
Title:  moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public
Title:  eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see the looks or
Title:  hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and drink to him.
Title:  Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud to be seen with
Title:  him, and tolerated by him, as
Title:  if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant
Title:  leading a menagerie into town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he
Title:  had been away at all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They
Title:  would have given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his, and
Title:  his glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a
Title:  circus.
Title:  
Title:     At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered such
Title:  eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not long in
Title:  becoming insufferably "stuck-up." They began to tell their adventures to
Title:  hungry listeners -- but they only began; it was not a thing likely to have
Title:  an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish material. And finally, when
Title:  they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around, the very summit
Title:  of glory was reached.
Title:  
Title:     Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory was
Title:  sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished, maybe
Title:  she would be wanting to "make up." Well, let her -- she should see that he
Title:  could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she arrived. Tom
Title:  pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls
Title:  and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and
Title:  forth with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing
Title:  schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture;
Title:  but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity, and that
Title:  she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times, too. It
Title:  gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning
Title:  him, it only "set him up" the more and made him the more diligent to avoid
Title:  betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking,
Title:  and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively
Title:  and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more
Title:  particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang and
Title:  grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her feet were
Title:  treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to a girl almost
Title:  at Tom's elbow -- with sham vivacity:
Title:  
Title:     "Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?"
Title:  
Title:     "I did come -- didn't you see me?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?"
Title:  
Title:     "I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw you."
Title:  
Title:     "Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about
Title:  the picnic."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?"
Title:  
Title:     "My ma's going to let me have one."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, goody; I hope she'll let me come."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I
Title:  want, and I want you."
Title:  
Title:     "That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?"
Title:  
Title:     "By and by. Maybe about vacation."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, every one that's friends to me -- or wants to be"; and she glanced
Title:  ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about
Title:  the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the great
Title:  sycamore tree "all to flinders" while he was "standing within three feet of
Title:  it."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, may I come?" said Grace Miller.
Title:  
Title:     "Yes."
Title:  
Title:     "And me?" said Sally Rogers.
Title:  
Title:     "Yes."
Title:  
Title:     "And me, too?" said Susy Harper. "And Joe?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes."
Title:  
Title:     And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
Title:  for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking,
Title:  and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes;
Title:  she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the
Title:  life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got
Title:  away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call "a good
Title:  cry." Then she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell rang. She roused
Title:  up, now, with a vindictive cast in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a
Title:  shake and said she knew what she'd do.
Title:  
Title:     At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
Title:  self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting
Title:  about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance. At last he spied
Title:  her, but there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily
Title:  on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with
Title:  Alfred Temple -- and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close
Title:  together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything
Title:  in the world besides. Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to
Title:  hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a
Title:  reconciliation. He called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could
Title:  think of. He wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they
Title:  walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function.
Title:  He did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he
Title:  could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as
Title:  otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the school-house, again and
Title:  again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could not
Title:  help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that Becky
Title:  Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living.
Title:  But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her fight, too,
Title:  and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.
Title:  
Title:     Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to
Title:  attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in vain
Title:  -- the girl chirped on. Tom thought, "Oh, hang her, ain't I ever going to
Title:  get rid of her?" At last he must be attending to those things -- and she
Title:  said artlessly that she would be "around" when school let out. And he
Title:  hastened away, hating her for it.
Title:  
Title:     "Any other boy!" Tom thought, grating his teeth. "Any boy in the whole
Title:  town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is
Title:  aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this
Title:  town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you out!
Title:  I'll just take and -- "
Title:  
Title:     And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy --
Title:  pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. "Oh, you do, do you? You holler
Title:  'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!" And so the imaginary
Title:  flogging was finished to his satisfaction.
Title:  
Title:     Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's
Title:  grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other
Title:  distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the
Title:  minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to cloud
Title:  and she lost interest; gravity and absent-mindedness followed, and then
Title:  melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it
Title:  was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew entirely miserable and
Title:  wished she hadn't carried it so far. When poor Alfred, seeing that he was
Title:  losing her,
Title:  he did not know how, kept exclaiming: "Oh,here's a jolly one! look at this!"
Title:  she lost patience at last, and said, "Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for
Title:  them!" and burst into tears, and got up and walked away.
Title:  
Title:     Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she
Title:  said:
Title:  
Title:     "Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!"
Title:  
Title:     So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done -- for she had said
Title:  she would look at pictures all through the nooning -- and she walked on,
Title:  crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted school-house. He was
Title:  humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth -- the girl had
Title:  simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer. He was
Title:  far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him. He wished
Title:  there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to
Title:  himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his opportunity.
Title:  He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the
Title:  page.
Title:  
Title:     Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act, and
Title:  moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now, intending
Title:  to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their troubles would be
Title:  healed. Before she was half way home, however, she had changed her mind. The
Title:  thought of Tom's treatment of her
Title:  when she was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her
Title:  with shame. She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged
Title:  spelling-book's account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                   Chapter XIX
Title:  
Title:     TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said
Title:  to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!"
Title:  
Title:     "Auntie, what have I done?"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old
Title:  softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage about that
Title:  dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that you was over
Title:  here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don't know what is to
Title:  become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so bad to think
Title:  you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and
Title:  never say a word."
Title:  
Title:     This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had
Title:  seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked mean
Title:  and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for
Title:  a moment. Then he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it -- but I didn't think."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own
Title:  selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson's
Title:  Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me
Title:  with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think to pity us and save us
Title:  from sorrow."
Title:  
Title:     "Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I didn't,
Title:  honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you that night."
Title:  
Title:     "What did you come for, then?"
Title:  
Title:     "It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got
Title:  drownded."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could
Title:  believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never did
Title:  -- and I know it, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie -- I wish I may never stir if I didn't."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Tom, don't lie -- don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times
Title:  worse."
Title:  
Title:     "It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from
Title:  grieving -- that was all that made me come."
Title:  
Title:     "I'd give the whole world to believe that -- it would cover up a power of
Title:  sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it ain't
Title:  reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me, child?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all
Title:  full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't
Title:  somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept
Title:  mum."
Title:  
Title:     "What bark?"
Title:  
Title:     "The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now,
Title:  you'd waked up when I kissed you -- I do, honest."
Title:  
Title:     The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned
Title:  in her eyes.
Title:  
Title:     " Did you kiss me, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, yes, I did."
Title:  
Title:     "Are you sure you did, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, yes, I did, auntie -- certain sure."
Title:  
Title:     "What did you kiss me for, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry."
Title:  
Title:     The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in her
Title:  voice when she said:
Title:  
Title:     "Kiss me again, Tom! -- and be off with you to school, now, and don't
Title:  bother me any more."
Title:  
Title:     The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a
Title:  jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her
Title:  hand, and said to herself:
Title:  
Title:     "No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it -- but it's a
Title:  blessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I hope the Lord
Title:  -- I know the Lord will forgive him, because it was such
Title:  goodheartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find out it's a lie.
Title:  I won't look."
Title:  
Title:     She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out
Title:  her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more she
Title:  ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought: "It's a good
Title:  lie -- it's a good lie -- I won't let it grieve me." So she sought the
Title:  jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's piece of bark through
Title:  flowing tears and saying: "I could forgive the boy, now, if he'd committed a
Title:  million sins!"
Title:

Title:                                   Chapter XX
Title:  
Title:     THERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom, that
Title:  swept away his low spirits and made him light-hearted and happy again. He
Title:  started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the head
Title:  of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a moment's
Title:  hesitation he ran to her and said:
Title:  
Title:     "I acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever, ever
Title:  do that way again, as long as ever I live -- please make up, won't you?"
Title:  
Title:     The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:
Title:  
Title:     "I'll thank you to keep yourself to yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll
Title:  never speak to you again."
Title:  
Title:     She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not
Title:  even presence of mind enough to say "Who cares, Miss Smarty?" until the
Title:  right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a fine
Title:  rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy, and
Title:  imagining how he would trounce her if she
Title:  were. He presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he
Title:  passed. She hurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It
Title:  seemed to Becky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for
Title:  school to "take in," she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured
Title:  spelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred
Title:  Temple, Tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away.
Title:  
Title:     Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself. The
Title:  master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition.
Title:  The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty had decreed that
Title:  he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster. Every day he took a
Title:  mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no
Title:  classes were reciting. He kept that book under lock and key. There was not
Title:  an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the
Title:  chance never came. Every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that
Title:  book; but no two theories were alike, and there was no way of getting at the
Title:  facts in the case. Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near
Title:  the door, she noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious
Title:  moment. She glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she
Title:  had the book in her hands. The title-page -- Professor Somebody's ANATOMY --
Title:  carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She
Title:  came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece -- a human
Title:  figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer
Title:  stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky snatched
Title:  at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page
Title:  half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk, turned the key,
Title:  and burst out crying with shame and vexation.
Title:  
Title:     "Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person
Title:  and look at what they're looking at."
Title:  
Title:     "How could I know you was looking at anything?"
Title:  
Title:     "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're going
Title:  to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be whipped,
Title:  and I never was whipped in school."
Title:  
Title:     Then she stamped her little foot and said:
Title:  
Title:     " Be so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen. You
Title:  just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!" -- and she flung out
Title:  of the house with a new explosion of crying.
Title:  
Title:     Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said to
Title:  himself:
Title:  
Title:     "What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in school!
Title:  Shucks! What's a licking! That's just like a girl -- they're so thin-skinned
Title:  and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain't going to tell old Dobbins on
Title:  this little fool, because there's
Title:  other ways of getting even on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old
Title:  Dobbins will ask who it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do
Title:  just the way he always does -- ask first one and then t'other, and when he
Title:  comes to the right girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces
Title:  always tell on them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well,
Title:  it's a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain't any way
Title:  out of it." Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: "All
Title:  right, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix -- let her sweat it
Title:  out!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the
Title:  master arrived and school "took in." Tom did not feel a strong interest in
Title:  his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls' side of the room
Title:  Becky's face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want to pity
Title:  her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get up no
Title:  exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the spelling-book
Title:  discovery was made, and Tom's mind was entirely full of his own matters for
Title:  a while after that. Becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed
Title:  good interest in the proceedings. She did not expect that Tom could get out
Title:  of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself; and she
Title:  was right. The denial only seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky
Title:  supposed she would be glad of that, and she tried to believe she was glad
Title:  of it, but she found she was not certain. When the worst came to the worst,
Title:  she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an
Title:  effort and forced herself to keep still -- because, said she to herself,
Title:  "he'll tell about me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to
Title:  save his life!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
Title:  broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset
Title:  the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout -- he had
Title:  denied it for form's sake and because it was custom, and had stuck to the
Title:  denial from principle.
Title:  
Title:     A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air
Title:  was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened
Title:  himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but
Title:  seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the pupils
Title:  glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched his
Title:  movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a
Title:  while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a
Title:  glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did,
Title:  with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot his quarrel with her.
Title:  Quick -- something must be done! done in a flash, too! But the very
Title:  imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention. Good! -- he had an
Title:  inspiration! He would run and snatch the
Title:  book, spring through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one
Title:  little instant, and the chance was lost -- the master opened the volume. If
Title:  Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help
Title:  for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school. Every
Title:  eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even the innocent
Title:  with fear. There was silence while one might count ten -- the master was
Title:  gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: "Who tore this book?"
Title:  
Title:     There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness
Title:  continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.
Title:  
Title:     "Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?"
Title:  
Title:     A denial. Another pause.
Title:  
Title:     "Joseph Harper, did you?"
Title:  
Title:     Another denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
Title:  slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of boys --
Title:  considered a while, then turned to the girls:
Title:  
Title:     "Amy Lawrence?"
Title:  
Title:     A shake of the head.
Title:  
Title:     "Gracie Miller?"
Title:  
Title:     The same sign.
Title:  
Title:     "Susan Harper, did you do this?"
Title:  
Title:     Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling
Title:  from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the
Title:  situation.
Title:  
Title:     "Rebecca Thatcher" [Tom glanced at her face -- it was white with terror]
Title:  -- "did you tear -- no, look me in the face" [her hands rose in appeal] --
Title:  "did you tear this book?"
Title:  
Title:     A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to his feet
Title:  and shouted -- " I done it!"
Title:  
Title:     The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a
Title:  moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward to
Title:  go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that shone
Title:  upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings.
Title:  Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most
Title:  merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and also
Title:  received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two
Title:  hours after school should be dismissed -- for he knew who would wait for him
Title:  outside till his captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss,
Title:  either.
Title:  
Title:     Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for
Title:  with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own
Title:  treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to
Title:  pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's latest words
Title:  lingering dreamily in his ear --
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, how could you be so noble!"
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                   Chapter XXI
Title:  
Title:     VACATION was approaching. The school-master, always severe, grew severer
Title:  and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing
Title:  on "Examination" day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now -- at
Title:  least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of
Title:  eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins' lashings were very
Title:  vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald
Title:  and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of
Title:  feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached, all the tyranny that
Title:  was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in
Title:  punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys
Title:  spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting
Title:  revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he
Title:  kept ahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful
Title:  success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the
Title:  field badly worsted. At last they conspired together
Title:  and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the
Title:  sign-painter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own
Title:  reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father's family
Title:  and had given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master's wife would go on
Title:  a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to
Title:  interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great
Title:  occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the sign-painter's boy said
Title:  that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination
Title:  Evening he would "manage the thing" while he napped in his chair; then he
Title:  would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.
Title:  
Title:     In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in the
Title:  evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with wreaths
Title:  and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in his great
Title:  chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him. He was looking
Title:  tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front
Title:  of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of
Title:  the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious
Title:  temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part
Title:  in the exercises of the evening; rows of small boys, washed and dressed to
Title:  an intolerable state of discomfort; rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of
Title:  girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious
Title:  of their bare arms, their grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink
Title:  and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was
Title:  filled with non-participating scholars.
Title:  
Title:     The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,
Title:  "You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage," etc. --
Title:  accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a
Title:  machine might have used -- supposing the machine to be a trifle out of
Title:  order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a fine
Title:  round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired.
Title:  
Title:     A little shamefaced girl lisped, "Mary had a little lamb," etc.,
Title:  performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and sat
Title:  down flushed and happy.
Title:  
Title:     Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the
Title:  unquenchable and indestructible "Give me liberty or give me death" speech,
Title:  with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the middle of
Title:  it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under him and he was
Title:  like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had
Title:  the house's silence, too, which was even worse than its sympathy. The master
Title:  frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom struggled awhile and then
Title:  retired, utterly
Title:  defeated. There was a weak attempt at applause, but it died early.
Title:  
Title:     "The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" followed; also "The Assyrian Came
Title:  Down," and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises, and a
Title:  spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The prime feature
Title:  of the evening was in order, now -- original "compositions" by the young
Title:  ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform,
Title:  cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and
Title:  proceeded to read, with labored attention to "expression" and punctuation.
Title:  The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by
Title:  their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their
Title:  ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades. "Friendship" was
Title:  one; "Memories of Other Days"; "Religion in History"; "Dream Land"; "The
Title:  Advantages of Culture"; "Forms of Political Government Compared and
Title:  Contrasted"; "Melancholy"; "Filial Love"; "Heart Longings," etc., etc.
Title:  
Title:     A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted
Title:  melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of "fine language";
Title:  another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and
Title:  phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that
Title:  conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate
Title:  and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and
Title:  every one of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brain-racking
Title:  effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and
Title:  religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity
Title:  of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion
Title:  from the schools, and it is not sufficient to-day; it never will be
Title:  sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all our
Title:  land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions
Title:  with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and
Title:  the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most
Title:  relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.
Title:  
Title:     Let us return to the "Examination." The first composition that was read
Title:  was one entitled "Is this, then, Life?" Perhaps the reader can endure an
Title:  extract from it:
Title:  
Title:  
Title:  
Title:       "In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does
Title:       the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of
Title:       festivity! Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of
Title:       joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid
Title:       the festive throng, 'the observed of all observers.' Her graceful
Title:       form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the
Title:       joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the
Title:       gay assembly.
Title:  
Title:  
Title:  
Title:       "In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome
Title:       hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she
Title:       has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear
Title:       to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the
Title:       last. But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly
Title:       exterior, all is vanity:
Title:       the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon
Title:       her ear; the ball-room has lost its charms; and with wasted health
Title:       and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that
Title:       earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!"
Title:  
Title:     And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to
Title:  time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of "How
Title:  sweet!" "How eloquent!" "So true!" etc., and after the thing had closed with
Title:  a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.
Title:  
Title:     Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the "interesting"
Title:  paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a "poem." Two stanzas
Title:  of it will do:
Title:  
Title:  
Title:  
Title:                     A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA
Title:  
Title:       "Alabama, good-bye! I love thee well!
Title:       But yet for a while do I leave thee now!
Title:       Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,
Title:       And burning recollections throng my brow!
Title:       For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;
Title:       Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;
Title:       Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,
Title:       And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.
Title:  
Title:       "Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart,
Title:       Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;
Title:       'Tis from no stranger land I now must part,
Title:       'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.
Title:       Welcome and home were mine within this State,
Title:       Whose vales I leave -- whose spires fade fast from me
Title:       And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,
Title:       When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!"
Title:  
Title:     There were very few there who knew what "tete"
Title:  meant, but the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.
Title:  
Title:     Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,
Title:  who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to
Title:  read in a measured, solemn tone:
Title:  
Title:  
Title:  
Title:                                    A VISION
Title:  
Title:       Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a
Title:       single star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy
Title:       thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific
Title:       lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of
Title:       heaven, seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the
Title:       illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came
Title:       forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to
Title:       enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.
Title:  
Title:  
Title:  
Title:       At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very
Title:       spirit sighed; but instead thereof,
Title:  
Title:      "My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide --
Title:  
Title:     My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,' came to my side. She moved like
Title:  one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy's Eden by
Title:  the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own
Title:  transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a
Title:  sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other
Title:  unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away un-perceived -- unsought. A
Title:  strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the robe of
Title:  December, as she pointed to the contending elements without, and bade me
Title:  contemplate the two beings presented."
Title:  
Title:     This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a
Title:  sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the
Title:  first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of
Title:  the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author
Title:  of it,
Title:  made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most "eloquent"
Title:  thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be
Title:  proud of it.
Title:  
Title:     It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which
Title:  the word "beauteous" was over-fondled, and human experience referred to as
Title:  "life's page," was up to the usual average.
Title:  
Title:     Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair
Title:  aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of America
Title:  on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he made a sad
Title:  business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over
Title:  the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it. He
Title:  sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than
Title:  ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his entire attention
Title:  upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. He
Title:  felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding,
Title:  and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased. And well it
Title:  might. There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his head; and
Title:  down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a
Title:  string; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing;
Title:  as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she
Title:  swung downward and clawed at the intangible air.
Title:  The tittering rose higher and higher -- the cat was within six inches of the
Title:  absorbed teacher's head -- down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his
Title:  wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the
Title:  garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the
Title:  light did blaze abroad from the master's bald pate -- for the sign-painter's
Title:  boy had gilded it!
Title:  
Title:     That broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.

Title:  Note: NOTE. -- The pretended "compositions" quoted in this chapter are taken

Title:                                  Chapter XXII
Title:  
Title:     TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the
Title:  showy character of their "regalia." He promised to abstain from smoking,
Title:  chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out a
Title:  new thing -- namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in
Title:  the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon found
Title:  himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so
Title:  intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red
Title:  sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth of July was coming;
Title:  but he soon gave that up -- gave it up before he had worn his shackles over
Title:  forty-eight hours -- and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of
Title:  the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public
Title:  funeral, since he was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply
Title:  concerned about the Judge's condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes
Title:  his hopes ran high -- so high that he would venture to get out his regalia
Title:  and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most
Title:  discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the mend --
Title:  and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too.
Title:  He handed in his resignation at once -- and that night the Judge suffered a
Title:  relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that
Title:  again.
Title:  
Title:     The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to
Title:  kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however -- there
Title:  was something in that. He could drink and swear, now -- but found to his
Title:  surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could, took the
Title:  desire away, and the charm of it.
Title:  
Title:     Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to
Title:  hang a little heavily on his hands.
Title:  
Title:     He attempted a diary -- but nothing happened during three days, and so he
Title:  abandoned it.
Title:  
Title:     The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a
Title:  sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy for
Title:  two days.
Title:  
Title:     Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained hard,
Title:  there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in the world
Title:  (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States Senator, proved an
Title:  overwhelming disappointment -- for he was not twenty-five feet high, nor
Title:  even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.
Title:  
Title:     A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents
Title:  made of rag carpeting -- admission, three pins for boys, two for girls --
Title:  and then circusing was abandoned.
Title:  
Title:     A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came -- and went again and left the
Title:  village duller and drearier than ever.
Title:  
Title:     There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few and so
Title:  delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.
Title:  
Title:     Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her
Title:  parents during vacation -- so there was no bright side to life anywhere.
Title:  
Title:     The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very
Title:  cancer for permanency and pain.
Title:  
Title:     Then came the measles.
Title:  
Title:     During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its
Title:  happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got upon
Title:  his feet at last and moved feebly down-town, a melancholy change had come
Title:  over everything and every creature. There had been a "revival," and
Title:  everybody had "got religion," not only the adults, but even the boys and
Title:  girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed
Title:  sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe Harper
Title:  studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle.
Title:  He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the
Title:  poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his
Title:  attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every
Title:  boy he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in
Title:  desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and
Title:  was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he crept home
Title:  and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost, forever and
Title:  forever.
Title:  
Title:     And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful
Title:  claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head with
Title:  the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for he had
Title:  not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him. He believed he
Title:  had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance
Title:  and that this was the result. It might have seemed to him a waste of pomp
Title:  and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but there seemed
Title:  nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunder-storm as
Title:  this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself.
Title:  
Title:     By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its
Title:  object. The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His second
Title:  was to wait -- for there might not be any more storms.
Title:  
Title:     The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he
Title:  spent on his back
Title:  this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad at last he was hardly
Title:  grateful that he had been spared, remembering how lonely was his estate, how
Title:  companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted listlessly down the street and
Title:  found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat
Title:  for murder, in the presence of her victim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and
Title:  Huck Finn up an alley eating a stolen melon. Poor lads! they -- like Tom --
Title:  had suffered a relapse.
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                  Chapter XXIII
Title:  
Title:     AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred -- and vigorously: the murder
Title:  trial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village talk
Title:  immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to the murder
Title:  sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience and fears almost
Title:  persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as "feelers";
Title:  he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the
Title:  murder, but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip.
Title:  It kept him in a cold shiver all the time. He took Huck to a lonely place to
Title:  have a talk with him. It would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a
Title:  little while; to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer.
Title:  Moreover, he wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet.
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, have you ever told anybody about -- that?"
Title:  
Title:     "'Bout what?"
Title:  
Title:     "You know what."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh -- 'course I haven't."
Title:  
Title:     "Never a word?"
Title:  
Title:     "Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I was afeard."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out.
Title:  You know that."
Title:  
Title:     Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?"
Title:  
Title:     "Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me they
Title:  could get me to tell. They ain't no different way."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we keep
Title:  mum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer."
Title:  
Title:     "I'm agreed."
Title:  
Title:     So they swore again with dread solemnities.
Title:  
Title:     "What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it."
Title:  
Title:     "Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the
Title:  time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide som'ers."
Title:  
Title:     "That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner.
Title:  Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?"
Title:  
Title:     "Most always -- most always. He ain't no account; but then he hain't ever
Title:  done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to get
Title:  drunk on -- and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do that --
Title:  leastways most of us --
Title:  preachers and such like. But he's kind of good -- he give me half a fish,
Title:  once, when there warn't enough for two; and lots of times he's kind of stood
Title:  by me when I was out of luck."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line. I
Title:  wish we could get him out of there."
Title:  
Title:     "My! we couldn't get him out, Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do any good;
Title:  they'd ketch him again."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes -- so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the
Title:  dickens when he never done -- that."
Title:  
Title:     "I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain
Title:  in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he
Title:  was to get free they'd lynch him."
Title:  
Title:     "And they'd do it, too."
Title:  
Title:     The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the
Title:  twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of
Title:  the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that something
Title:  would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But nothing happened;
Title:  there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive.
Title:  
Title:     The boys did as they had often done before -- went to the cell grating
Title:  and gave Potter some tobacco
Title:  and matches. He was on the ground floor and there were no guards.
Title:  
Title:     His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before
Title:  -- it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and treacherous to
Title:  the last degree when Potter said:
Title:  
Title:     "You've been mighty good to me, boys -- better'n anybody else in this
Title:  town. And I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says to myself, says I, 'I
Title:  used to mend all the boys' kites and things, and show 'em where the good
Title:  fishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I could, and now they've all
Title:  forgot old Muff when he's in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck don't -- they
Title:  don't forget him, says I, 'and I don't forget them.' Well, boys, I done an
Title:  awful thing -- drunk and crazy at the time -- that's the only way I account
Title:  for it -- and now I got to swing for it, and it's right. Right, and best,
Title:  too, I reckon -- hope so, anyway. Well, we won't talk about that. I don't
Title:  want to make you feel bad; you've befriended me. But what I want to say, is,
Title:  don't you ever get drunk -- then you won't ever get here. Stand a litter
Title:  furder west -- so -- that's it; it's a prime comfort to see faces that's
Title:  friendly when a body's in such a muck of trouble, and there don't none come
Title:  here but yourn. Good friendly faces -- good friendly faces. Git up on one
Title:  another's backs and let me touch 'em. That's it. Shake hands -- yourn'll
Title:  come through the bars, but mine's too big. Little hands, and weak -- but
Title:  they've helped Muff
Title:  Potter a power, and they'd help him more if they could."
Title:  
Title:     Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.
Title:  The next day and the day after, he hung about the court-room, drawn by an
Title:  almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out. Huck
Title:  was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other. Each
Title:  wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination always
Title:  brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered
Title:  out of the court-room, but invariably heard distressing news -- the toils
Title:  were closing more and more relentlessly around poor Potter. At the end of
Title:  the second day the village talk was to the effect that Injun Joe's evidence
Title:  stood firm and unshaken, and that there was not the slightest question as to
Title:  what the jury's verdict would be.
Title:  
Title:     Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He was
Title:  in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to sleep.
Title:  All the village flocked to the court-house the next morning, for this was to
Title:  be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented in the packed
Title:  audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places; shortly
Title:  afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in,
Title:  with chains upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at
Title:  him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever. There was another
Title:  pause, and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of
Title:  the court. The usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of
Title:  papers followed. These details and accompanying delays worked up an
Title:  atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating.
Title:  
Title:     Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing
Title:  in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was
Title:  discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further
Title:  questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:
Title:  
Title:     "Take the witness."
Title:  
Title:     The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when
Title:  his own counsel said:
Title:  
Title:     "I have no questions to ask him."
Title:  
Title:     The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse. Counsel
Title:  for the prosecution said:
Title:  
Title:     "Take the witness."
Title:  
Title:     "I have no questions to ask him," Potter's lawyer replied.
Title:  
Title:     A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's possession.
Title:  
Title:     "Take the witness."
Title:  
Title:     Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience
Title:  began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his client's
Title:  life without an effort?
Title:  
Title:     Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior when
Title:  brought to the scene of the
Title:  murder. They were allowed to leave the stand without being cross-questioned.
Title:  
Title:     Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard
Title:  upon that morning which all present remembered so well was brought out by
Title:  credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined by Potter's lawyer.
Title:  The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs
Title:  and provoked a reproof from the bench. Counsel for the prosecution now said:
Title:  
Title:     "By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have
Title:  fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the
Title:  unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here."
Title:  
Title:     A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and
Title:  rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in the
Title:  court-room. Many men were moved, and many women's compassion testified
Title:  itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we foreshadowed
Title:  our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed while under the
Title:  influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink. We have
Title:  changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea." [Then to the clerk:] "Call
Title:  Thomas Sawyer!"
Title:  
Title:     A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting
Title:  Potter's. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as he
Title:  rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough, for he
Title:  was badly scared. The oath was administered.
Title:  
Title:     "Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the hour
Title:  of midnight?"
Title:  
Title:     Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him. The
Title:  audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few
Title:  moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed to
Title:  put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:
Title:  
Title:     "In the graveyard!"
Title:  
Title:     "A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You were -- "
Title:  
Title:     "In the graveyard."
Title:  
Title:     A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.
Title:  
Title:     "Were you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, sir."
Title:  
Title:     "Speak up -- just a trifle louder. How near were you?"
Title:  
Title:     "Near as I am to you."
Title:  
Title:     "Were you hidden, or not?"
Title:  
Title:     "I was hid."
Title:  
Title:     "Where?"
Title:  
Title:     "Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave."
Title:  
Title:     Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.
Title:  
Title:     "Any one with you?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, sir. I went there with -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Wait -- wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion's name. We
Title:  will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with you."
Title:  
Title:     Tom hesitated and looked confused.
Title:  
Title:     "Speak out, my boy -- don't be diffident. The truth is always
Title:  respectable. What did you take there?"
Title:  
Title:     "Only a -- a -- dead cat."
Title:  
Title:     There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.
Title:  
Title:     "We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us
Title:  everything that occurred -- tell it in your own way -- don't skip anything,
Title:  and don't be afraid."
Title:  
Title:     Tom began -- hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his
Title:  words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased but
Title:  his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and bated
Title:  breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time, rapt in the
Title:  ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent emotion reached its
Title:  climax when the boy said:
Title:  
Title:     " -- and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell,
Title:  Injun Joe jumped with the knife and -- "
Title:  
Title:     Crash! Quick as lightning the half-breed sprang for a window, tore his
Title:  way through all opposers, and was gone!
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                  Chapter XXIV
Title:  
Title:     TOM was a glittering hero once more -- the pet of the old, the envy of
Title:  the young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper
Title:  magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet, if
Title:  he escaped hanging.
Title:  
Title:     As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom and
Title:  fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort of
Title:  conduct is to the world's credit; therefore it is not well to find fault
Title:  with it.
Title:  
Title:     Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights
Title:  were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always with
Title:  doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad
Title:  after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of wretchedness and terror,
Title:  for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great
Title:  day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the business
Title:  might leak out, yet, notwithstanding Injun Joe's flight had saved him the
Title:  suffering of testifying in court. The poor fellow had got the attorney to
Title:  promise secrecy, but
Title:  what of that? Since Tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to
Title:  the lawyer's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been
Title:  sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck's confidence in
Title:  the human race was well-nigh obliterated.
Title:  
Title:     Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly he
Title:  wished he had sealed up his tongue.
Title:  
Title:     Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the other
Title:  half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a safe
Title:  breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.
Title:  
Title:     Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun Joe
Title:  was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a detective,
Title:  came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked wise, and made
Title:  that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve.
Title:  That is to say, he "found a clew." But you can't hang a "clew" for murder,
Title:  and so after that detective had got through and gone home, Tom felt just as
Title:  insecure as he was before.
Title:  
Title:     The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
Title:  weight of apprehension.
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                   Chapter XXV
Title:  
Title:     THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when he has a
Title:  raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire
Title:  suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper, but
Title:  failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing. Presently
Title:  he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would answer. Tom took him
Title:  to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially. Huck was
Title:  willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that
Title:  offered entertainment and required no capital, for he had a troublesome
Title:  superabundance of that sort of time which is not money. "Where'll we dig?"
Title:  said Huck.
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, most anywhere."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, is it hid all around?"
Title:  
Title:     "No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck --
Title:  sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of
Title:  an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under
Title:  the floor in ha'nted houses."
Title:  
Title:     "Who hides it?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, robbers, of course -- who'd you reckon? Sunday-school
Title:  sup'rintendents?"
Title:  
Title:     "I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it and have a
Title:  good time."
Title:  
Title:     "So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide it and leave
Title:  it there."
Title:  
Title:     "Don't they come after it any more?"
Title:  
Title:     "No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else
Title:  they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and by
Title:  somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks -- a
Title:  paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's mostly signs
Title:  and hy'roglyphics."
Title:  
Title:     "Hyro which?"
Title:  
Title:     "Hy'roglyphics -- pictures and things, you know, that don't seem to mean
Title:  anything."
Title:  
Title:     "Have you got one of them papers, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "No."
Title:  
Title:     "Well then, how you going to find the marks?"
Title:  
Title:     "I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted house or on
Title:  an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out. Well,
Title:  we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we can try it again some time;
Title:  and there's the old ha'nted house up the Still-House branch, and there's
Title:  lots of deadlimb trees -- dead loads of 'em."
Title:  
Title:     "Is it under all of them?"
Title:  
Title:     "How you talk! No!"
Title:  
Title:     "Then how you going to know which one to go for?"
Title:  
Title:     "Go for all of 'em!"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, Tom, it'll take all summer."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars
Title:  in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di'monds. How's that?"
Title:  
Title:     Huck's eyes glowed.
Title:  
Title:     "That's bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred
Title:  dollars and I don't want no di'monds."
Title:  
Title:     "All right. But I bet you I ain't going to throw off on di'monds. Some of
Title:  'em's worth twenty dollars apiece -- there ain't any, hardly, but's worth
Title:  six bits or a dollar."
Title:  
Title:     "No! Is that so?"
Title:  
Title:     "Cert'nly -- anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen one, Huck?"
Title:  
Title:     "Not as I remember."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, kings have slathers of them."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I don' know no kings, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a raft of
Title:  'em hopping around."
Title:  
Title:     "Do they hop?"
Title:  
Title:     "Hop? -- your granny! No!"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, what did you say they did, for?"
Title:  
Title:     "Shucks, I only meant you'd see 'em -- not hopping, of course -- what do
Title:  they want to hop for? -- but I mean you'd just see 'em -- scattered around,
Title:  you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard."
Title:  
Title:     "Richard? What's his other name?"
Title:  
Title:     "He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given name."
Title:  
Title:     "No?"
Title:  
Title:     "But they don't."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don't want to be a king and
Title:  have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say -- where you going to
Title:  dig first?"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the hill
Title:  t'other side of Still-House branch?"
Title:  
Title:     "I'm agreed."
Title:  
Title:     So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their three-mile
Title:  tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves down in the shade
Title:  of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.
Title:  
Title:     "I like this," said Tom.
Title:  
Title:     "So do I."
Title:  
Title:     "Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your
Title:  share?"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I'll go to every
Title:  circus that comes along. I bet I'll have a gay time."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, ain't you going to save any of it?"
Title:  
Title:     "Save it? What for?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day
Title:  and get his claws on it
Title:  if I didn't hurry up, and I tell you he'd clean it out pretty quick. What
Title:  you going to do with yourn, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure-'nough sword, and a red necktie
Title:  and a bull pup, and get married."
Title:  
Title:     "Married!"
Title:  
Title:     "That's it."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, you -- why, you ain't in your right mind."
Title:  
Title:     "Wait -- you'll see."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my
Title:  mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty
Title:  well."
Title:  
Title:     "That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't fight."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now you better
Title:  think 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's the name of the gal?"
Title:  
Title:     "It ain't a gal at all -- it's a girl."
Title:  
Title:     "It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl -- both's
Title:  right, like enough. Anyway, what's her name, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "I'll tell you some time -- not now."
Title:  
Title:     "All right -- that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more lonesomer
Title:  than ever."
Title:  
Title:     "No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and
Title:  we'll go to digging."
Title:  
Title:     They worked and sweated for half an hour. No
Title:  result. They toiled another half-hour. Still no result. Huck said:
Title:  
Title:     "Do they always bury it as deep as this?"
Title:  
Title:     "Sometimes -- not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't got the
Title:  right place."
Title:  
Title:     So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little, but
Title:  still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time. Finally
Title:  Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his
Title:  sleeve, and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?"
Title:  
Title:     "I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on Cardiff
Title:  Hill back of the widow's."
Title:  
Title:     "I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it away from
Title:  us, Tom? It's on her land."
Title:  
Title:     "She take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever finds one of
Title:  these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make any difference whose
Title:  land it's on."
Title:  
Title:     That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:
Title:  
Title:     "Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?"
Title:  
Title:     "It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes witches
Title:  interfere. I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble now."
Title:  
Title:     "Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!
Title:  What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow of
Title:  the limb falls at midnight, and that's where you dig!"
Title:  
Title:     "Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang
Title:  it all, we got to come back in the night. It's an awful long way. Can you
Title:  get out?"
Title:  
Title:     "I bet I will. We've got to do it to-night, too, because if somebody sees
Title:  these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for it."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I'll come around and maow to-night."
Title:  
Title:     "All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes."
Title:  
Title:     The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in the
Title:  shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by old
Title:  traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the
Title:  murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an
Title:  owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were subdued by these
Title:  solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged that twelve had come;
Title:  they marked where the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced
Title:  to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it.
Title:  The hole deepened and still deepened, but every time their hearts jumped to
Title:  hear the pick strike upon something, they only suffered a new
Title:  disappointment. It was only a stone or a chunk. At last Tom said:
Title:     "It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, but we can't be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot."
Title:  
Title:     "I know it, but then there's another thing."
Title:  
Title:     "What's that?".
Title:  
Title:     "Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too
Title:  early."
Title:  
Title:     Huck dropped his shovel.
Title:  
Title:     "That's it," said he. "That's the very trouble. We got to give this one
Title:  up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing's too
Title:  awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around
Title:  so. I feel as if something's behind me all the time; and I'm afeard to turn
Title:  around, becuz maybe there's others in front a-waiting for a chance. I been
Title:  creeping all over, ever since I got here."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a
Title:  dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it."
Title:  
Title:     "Lordy!"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, they do. I've always heard that."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A
Title:  body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure."
Title:  
Title:     "I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was to stick
Title:  his skull out and say something!"
Title:  
Title:     "Don't Tom! It's awful."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit."
Title:  
Title:     "Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres else."
Title:  
Title:     "All right, I reckon we better."
Title:  
Title:     "What'll it be?"
Title:  
Title:     Tom considered awhile; and then said:
Title:  
Title:     "The ha'nted house. That's it!"
Title:  
Title:     "Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight
Title:  worse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don't come
Title:  sliding around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and peep over your
Title:  shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I
Title:  couldn't stand such a thing as that, Tom -- nobody could."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't
Title:  hender us from digging there in the daytime."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that
Title:  ha'nted house in the day nor the night."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been
Title:  murdered, anyway -- but nothing's ever been seen around that house except in
Title:  the night -- just some blue lights slipping by the windows -- no regular
Title:  ghosts."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you
Title:  can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz
Title:  you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use 'em."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the daytime, so
Title:  what's the use of our being afeard?"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so -- but I
Title:  reckon it's taking chances."
Title:  
Title:     They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the
Title:  moonlit valley below them stood the "ha'nted" house, utterly isolated, its
Title:  fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the chimney
Title:  crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof caved in.
Title:  The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit past a
Title:  window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the
Title:  circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted house a
Title:  wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the
Title:  rearward side of Cardiff Hill.

Title:  
Title:                                  Chapter XXVI
Title:  
Title:     ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come
Title:  for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was
Title:  measurably so, also -- but suddenly said:
Title:  
Title:     "Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?"
Title:  
Title:     Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his
Title:  eyes with a startled look in them --
Title:  
Title:     "My! I never once thought of it, Huck!"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was
Title:  Friday."
Title:  
Title:     "Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got into an
Title:  awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday."
Title:  
Title:     "Might ! Better say we would! There's some lucky days, maybe, but Friday
Title:  ain't."
Title:  
Title:     "Any fool knows that. I don't reckon you was the first that found it out,
Title:  Huck."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither. I had a
Title:  rotten bad dream last night -- dreampt about rats."
Title:  
Title:     "No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?"
Title:  
Title:     "No."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign that
Title:  there's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty sharp
Title:  and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for to-day, and play. Do you know
Title:  Robin Hood, Huck?"
Title:  
Title:     "No. Who's Robin Hood?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England -- and the
Title:  best. He was a robber."
Title:  
Title:     "Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?"
Title:  
Title:     "Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But
Title:  he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always divided up with 'em
Title:  perfectly square."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, he must 'a' been a brick."
Title:  
Title:     "I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They
Title:  ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in England,
Title:  with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a
Title:  ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half."
Title:  
Title:     "What's a yew bow?"
Title:  
Title:     "I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that
Title:  dime only on the edge he would set down and cry -- and curse. But we'll play
Title:  Robin Hood -- it's nobby fun. I'll learn you."
Title:  
Title:     "I'm agreed."
Title:  
Title:     So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a
Title:  yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the
Title:  morrow's prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink into
Title:  the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees
Title:  and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.
Title:  
Title:     On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.
Title:  They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their
Title:  last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were so
Title:  many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within
Title:  six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and turned it up
Title:  with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this time, however, so
Title:  the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not
Title:  trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to
Title:  the business of treasure-hunting.
Title:  
Title:     When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
Title:  grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun, and
Title:  something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place,
Title:  that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they crept to the
Title:  door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weed-grown, floorless room,
Title:  unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and
Title:  here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They
Title:  presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears
Title:  alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant
Title:  retreat.
Title:  
Title:     In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the
Title:  place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own
Title:  boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look up-stairs. This
Title:  was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each other,
Title:  and of course there could be but one result -- they threw their tools into a
Title:  corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of decay. In one
Title:  corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a
Title:  fraud -- there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand.
Title:  They were about to go down and begin work when --
Title:  
Title:     "Sh!" said Tom.
Title:  
Title:     "What is it?" whispered Huck, blanching with fright.
Title:  
Title:     "Sh! ... There! ... Hear it?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes! ... Oh, my! Let's run!"
Title:  
Title:     "Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the door."
Title:  
Title:     The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
Title:  knot-holes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.
Title:  
Title:     "They've stopped.... No -- coming.... Here they are. Don't whisper
Title:  another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!"
Title:  
Title:     Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: "There's the old deaf and dumb
Title:  Spaniard that's
Title:  been about town once or twice lately -- never saw t'other man before."
Title:  
Title:     "T'other" was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant in
Title:  his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white whiskers;
Title:  long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore green goggles.
Title:  When they came in, "t'other" was talking in a low voice; they sat down on
Title:  the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker
Title:  continued his remarks. His manner became less guarded and his words more
Title:  distinct as he proceeded:
Title:  
Title:     "No," said he, "I've thought it all over, and I don't like it. It's
Title:  dangerous."
Title:  
Title:     "Dangerous!" grunted the "deaf and dumb" Spaniard -- to the vast surprise
Title:  of the boys. "Milksop!"
Title:  
Title:     This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's! There was
Title:  silence for some time. Then Joe said:
Title:  
Title:     "What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder -- but nothing's come
Title:  of it."
Title:  
Title:     "That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.
Title:  'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn't succeed."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime! -- anybody
Title:  would suspicion us that saw us."
Title:  
Title:     "I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after that fool
Title:  of a job. I want to quit
Title:  this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it warn't any use trying to stir
Title:  out of here, with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right
Title:  in full view."
Title:  
Title:     "Those infernal boys" quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,
Title:  and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and
Title:  concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a year.
Title:  
Title:     The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and
Title:  thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:
Title:  
Title:     "Look here, lad -- you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there
Title:  till you hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping into this town just
Title:  once more, for a look. We'll do that 'dangerous' job after I've spied around
Title:  a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas! We'll leg it
Title:  together!"
Title:  
Title:     This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe
Title:  said:
Title:  
Title:     "I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch."
Title:  
Title:     He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred
Title:  him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to nod;
Title:  his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.
Title:  
Title:     The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:
Title:  
Title:     "Now's our chance -- come!"
Title:  
Title:     Huck said:
Title:  
Title:     "I can't -- I'd die if they was to wake."
Title:  
Title:     Tom urged -- Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and
Title:  started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from
Title:  the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never made a
Title:  second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it
Title:  seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray; and then
Title:  they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.
Title:  
Title:     Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around -- smiled grimly
Title:  upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees -- stirred him up
Title:  with his foot and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Here! You're a watchman, ain't you! All right, though -- nothing's
Title:  happened."
Title:  
Title:     "My! have I been asleep?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What'll we do
Title:  with what little swag we've got left?"
Title:  
Title:     "I don't know -- leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No use to
Title:  take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver's
Title:  something to carry."
Title:  
Title:     "Well -- all right -- it won't matter to come here once more."
Title:  
Title:     "No -- but I'd say come in the night as we used to do -- it's better."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes: but look here; it may be a good while
Title:  before I get the right chance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't
Title:  in such a very good place; we'll just regularly bury it -- and bury it
Title:  deep."
Title:  
Title:     "Good idea," said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,
Title:  raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled
Title:  pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and
Title:  as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on his
Title:  knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.
Title:  
Title:     The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With
Title:  gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck! -- the splendor of it was
Title:  beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a
Title:  dozen boys rich! Here was treasure hunting under the happiest auspices --
Title:  there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig. They
Title:  nudged each other every moment -- eloquent nudges and easily understood, for
Title:  they simply meant -- "Oh, but ain't you glad now we're here!"
Title:  
Title:     Joe's knife struck upon something.
Title:  
Title:     "Hello!" said he.
Title:  
Title:     "What is it?" said his comrade.
Title:  
Title:     "Half-rotten plank -- no, it's a box, I believe. Here -- bear a hand and
Title:  we'll see what it's here for. Never mind, I've broke a hole."
Title:  
Title:     He reached his hand in and drew it out --
Title:  
Title:     "Man, it's money!"
Title:  
Title:     The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys above
Title:  were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.
Title:  
Title:     Joe's comrade said:
Title:  
Title:     "We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over amongst
Title:  the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace -- I saw it a minute
Title:  ago."
Title:  
Title:     He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the pick,
Title:  looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to himself,
Title:  and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was not very large;
Title:  it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured
Title:  it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence.
Title:  
Title:     "Pard, there's thousands of dollars here," said Injun Joe.
Title:  
Title:     "'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one summer,"
Title:  the stranger observed.
Title:  
Title:     "I know it," said Injun Joe; "and this looks like it, I should say."
Title:  
Title:     "Now you won't need to do that job."
Title:  
Title:     The half-breed frowned. Said he:
Title:  
Title:     "You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing. 'Tain't
Title:  robbery altogether -- it's revenge!" and a wicked light flamed in his eyes.
Title:  "I'll need your help in it. When it's finished -- then Texas. Go home to
Title:  your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me."
Title:  
Title:     "Well -- if you say so; what'll we do with this -- bury it again?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] No ! by the great Sachem, no!
Title:  [Profound distress overhead.] I'd nearly forgot. That pick had fresh earth
Title:  on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business has a
Title:  pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on them? Who brought
Title:  them here -- and where are they gone? Have you heard anybody? -- seen
Title:  anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground
Title:  disturbed? Not exactly -- not exactly. We'll take it to my den."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number One?"
Title:  
Title:     "No -- Number Two -- under the cross. The other place is bad -- too
Title:  common."
Title:  
Title:     "All right. It's nearly dark enough to start."
Title:  
Title:     Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping
Title:  out. Presently he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be
Title:  up-stairs?"
Title:  
Title:     The boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,
Title:  halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The boys
Title:  thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came creaking
Title:  up the stairs -- the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken
Title:  resolution of the lads -- they were about to spring for the closet, when
Title:  there was a crash of rotten timbers
Title:  and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway.
Title:  He gathered himself up cursing, and his comrade said:
Title:  
Title:     "Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're up there,
Title:  let them stay there -- who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get
Title:  into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes -- and then
Title:  let them follow us if they want to. I'm willing. In my opinion, whoever hove
Title:  those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils
Title:  or something. I'll bet they're running yet."
Title:  
Title:     Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight
Title:  was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving. Shortly
Title:  afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight, and moved
Title:  toward the river with their precious box.
Title:  
Title:     Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them
Title:  through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They
Title:  were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the
Title:  townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much
Title:  absorbed in hating themselves -- hating the ill luck that made them take the
Title:  spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have
Title:  suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till
Title:  his "revenge" was satisfied, and then he would have had the misfortune to
Title:  find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that the tools were
Title:  ever brought there!
Title:  
Title:     They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to
Title:  town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to
Title:  "Number Two," wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to
Title:  Tom.
Title:  
Title:     "Revenge? What if he means us, Huck!"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, don't!" said Huck, nearly fainting.
Title:  
Title:     They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe
Title:  that he might possibly mean somebody else -- at least that he might at least
Title:  mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.
Title:  
Title:     Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company
Title:  would be a palpable improvement, he thought.

Title:  
Title:                                  Chapter XXVII
Title:  
Title:     THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom's dreams that night. Four
Title:  times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to
Title:  nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back
Title:  the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay in the early morning recalling
Title:  the incidents of his great adventure, he noticed that they seemed curiously
Title:  subdued and far away -- somewhat as if they had happened in another world,
Title:  or in a time long gone by. Then it occurred to him that the great adventure
Title:  itself must be a dream! There was one very strong argument in favor of this
Title:  idea -- namely, that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be
Title:  real. He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he
Title:  was like all boys of his age and station in life, in that he imagined that
Title:  all references to "hundreds" and "thousands" were mere fanciful forms of
Title:  speech, and that no such sums really existed in the world. He never had
Title:  supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be
Title:  found in actual money in any one's possession. If his notions of hidden
Title:  treasure had been
Title:  analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes
Title:  and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.
Title:  
Title:     But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer
Title:  under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found himself
Title:  leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream, after
Title:  all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a hurried
Title:  breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a
Title:  flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very
Title:  melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If he did not
Title:  do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream.
Title:  
Title:     "Hello, Huck!"
Title:  
Title:     "Hello, yourself."
Title:  
Title:     Silence, for a minute.
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd 'a' got the
Title:  money. Oh, ain't it awful!"
Title:  
Title:     "'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.
Title:  Dog'd if I don't, Huck."
Title:  
Title:     "What ain't a dream?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was."
Title:  
Title:     "Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much dream it
Title:  was! I've had dreams enough all night -- with that patch-eyed Spanish devil
Title:  going for me all through 'em -- rot him!"
Title:  
Title:     "No, not rot him. Find him! Track the money!"
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance for such
Title:  a pile -- and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,
Title:  anyway."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway -- and track him out -- to
Title:  his Number Two."
Title:  
Title:     "Number Two -- yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I can't
Title:  make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?"
Title:  
Title:     "I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck -- maybe it's the number of a house!"
Title:  
Title:     "Goody! ... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse
Title:  town. They ain't no numbers here."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here -- it's the number of a room
Title:  -- in a tavern, you know!"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find out
Title:  quick."
Title:  
Title:     "You stay here, Huck, till I come."
Title:  
Title:     Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in public
Title:  places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No. 2
Title:  had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied. In the
Title:  less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper's young son
Title:  said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or
Title:  come out of it
Title:  except at night; he did not know any particular reason for this state of
Title:  things; had had some little curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made
Title:  the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room
Title:  was "ha'nted"; had noticed that there was a light in there the night before.
Title:  
Title:     "That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No. 2 we're
Title:  after."
Title:  
Title:     "I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?"
Title:  
Title:     "Lemme think."
Title:  
Title:     Tom thought a long time. Then he said:
Title:  
Title:     "I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out
Title:  into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a
Title:  brick store. Now you get hold of all the door-keys you can find, and I'll
Title:  nip all of auntie's, and the first dark night we'll go there and try 'em.
Title:  And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to
Title:  drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge. If
Title:  you see him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to that No. 2, that
Title:  ain't the place."
Title:  
Title:     "Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you -- and if he did,
Title:  maybe he'd never think anything."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I dono -- I dono.
Title:  I'll try."
Title:  
Title:     "You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck.
Title:  Why, he might 'a' found out he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right
Title:  after that money."
Title:  
Title:     "It's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by jingoes!"
Title:  
Title:     "Now you're talking! Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I won't."
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                 Chapter XXVIII
Title:  
Title:     THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about
Title:  the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley at a
Title:  distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or left it;
Title:  nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door. The night
Title:  promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a
Title:  considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck was to come and "maow,"
Title:  whereupon he would slip out and try the keys. But the night remained clear,
Title:  and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead
Title:  about twelve.
Title:  
Title:     Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday
Title:  night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's old
Title:  tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the lantern in
Title:  Huck's sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before midnight the
Title:  tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out. No
Title:  Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the alley. Everything
Title:  was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was
Title:  interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder.
Title:  
Title:     Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the
Title:  towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern. Huck
Title:  stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was a season of
Title:  waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's spirits like a mountain. He began
Title:  to wish he could see a flash from the lantern -- it would frighten him, but
Title:  it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet. It seemed hours since Tom
Title:  had disappeared. Surely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his
Title:  heart had burst under terror and excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found
Title:  himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of
Title:  dreadful things, and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that
Title:  would take away his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed
Title:  only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself
Title:  out, the way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom
Title:  came tearing by him: . "Run!" said he; "run, for your life!"
Title:  
Title:     He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or
Title:  forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never
Title:  stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the
Title:  lower end of the village. Just
Title:  as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down. As
Title:  soon as Tom got his breath he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;
Title:  but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly get my
Title:  breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn in the lock, either. Well,
Title:  without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes
Title:  the door! It warn't locked! I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, great
Title:  Caesar's ghost!"
Title:  
Title:     "What! -- what'd you see, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!"
Title:  
Title:     "No!"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch
Title:  on his eye and his arms spread out."
Title:  
Title:     "Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?"
Title:  
Title:     "No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and
Title:  started!"
Title:  
Title:     "I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it."
Title:  
Title:     "Say, Tom, did you see that box?"
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see
Title:  the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by
Title:  Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. Don't
Title:  you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?"
Title:  
Title:     "How?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe all the Temperance Taverns have
Title:  got a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But say,
Title:  Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's drunk."
Title:  
Title:     "It is, that! You try it!"
Title:  
Title:     Huck shuddered.
Title:  
Title:     "Well, no -- I reckon not."
Title:  
Title:     "And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle along-side of Injun Joe ain't
Title:  enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it."
Title:  
Title:     There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun
Title:  Joe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we'll be
Title:  dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we'll snatch that
Title:  box quicker'n lightning."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it every
Title:  night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job."
Title:  
Title:     "All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block
Title:  and maow -- and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and
Title:  that'll fetch me."
Title:  
Title:     "Agreed, and good as wheat!"
Title:  
Title:     "Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go
Title:  home. It'll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch
Title:  that long, will you?"
Title:  
Title:     "I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every night for
Title:  a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night."
Title:  
Title:     "That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?"
Title:  
Title:     "In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's nigger man,
Title:  Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any
Title:  time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.
Title:  That's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don't ever act as if
Title:  I was above him. Sometime I've set right down and eat with him. But you
Title:  needn't tell that. A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry he
Title:  wouldn't want to do as a steady thing."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I won't
Title:  come bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in the night, just
Title:  skip right around and maow."
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                  Chapter XXIX
Title:  
Title:     THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news --
Title:  Judge Thatcher's family had come back to town the night before. Both Injun
Title:  Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment, and Becky
Title:  took the chief place in the boy's interest. He saw her and they had an
Title:  exhausting good time playing "hispy" and "gully-keeper" with a crowd of
Title:  their school-mates. The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly
Title:  satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the
Title:  long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented. The child's
Title:  delight was boundless; and Tom's not more moderate. The invitations were
Title:  sent out before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the village were
Title:  thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation. Tom's
Title:  excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour, and he had
Title:  good hopes of hearing Huck's "maow," and of having his treasure to astonish
Title:  Becky and the picnickers with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal
Title:  came that night.
Title:  
Title:     Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and
Title:  rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything was
Title:  ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
Title:  picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough under
Title:  the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of
Title:  twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the
Title:  occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with
Title:  provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the fun; Mary remained at
Title:  home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky, was:
Title:  
Title:     "You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all night with
Title:  some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child."
Title:  
Title:     "Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma."
Title:  
Title:     "Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble."
Title:  
Title:     Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:
Title:  
Title:     "Say -- I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe Harper's
Title:  we'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas'. She'll have
Title:  ice-cream! She has it most every day -- dead loads of it. And she'll be
Title:  awful glad to have us."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, that will be fun!"
Title:  
Title:     Then Becky reflected a moment and said:
Title:  
Title:     "But what will mamma say?"
Title:  
Title:     "How'll she ever know?"
Title:  
Title:     The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:
Title:  
Title:     "I reckon it's wrong -- but -- "
Title:  
Title:     "But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she
Title:  wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if she'd
Title:  'a' thought of it. I know she would!"
Title:  
Title:     The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and Tom's
Title:  persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing
Title:  anybody about the night's programme. Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe
Title:  Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal
Title:  of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up
Title:  the fun at Widow Douglas'. And why should he give it up, he reasoned -- the
Title:  signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely to
Title:  come to-night? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain
Title:  treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination
Title:  and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day.
Title:  
Title:     Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
Title:  hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances
Title:  and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All the
Title:  different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by and
Title:  by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites,
Title:  and then the destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was
Title:  a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks.
Title:  By-and-by somebody shouted:
Title:  
Title:     "Who's ready for the cave?"
Title:  
Title:     Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there
Title:  was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside
Title:  -- an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred.
Title:  Within was a small chamber, chilly as an ice-house, and walled by Nature
Title:  with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and
Title:  mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green
Title:  valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly
Title:  wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted there
Title:  was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence
Title:  followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there
Title:  was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things have an end.
Title:  By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main
Title:  avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of
Title:  rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue
Title:  was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and
Title:  still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand -- for Mc-
Title:  Dougal's cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each
Title:  other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days
Title:  and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and
Title:  never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and
Title:  still down, into the earth, and it was just the same -- labyrinth under
Title:  labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man "knew" the cave. That was an
Title:  impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it was not
Title:  customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer knew as much
Title:  of the cave as any one.
Title:  
Title:     The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile,
Title:  and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues, fly
Title:  along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise at points where
Title:  the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude each other for the
Title:  space of half an hour without going beyond the "known" ground.
Title:  
Title:     By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of
Title:  the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow
Title:  drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of the
Title:  day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of
Title:  time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had been calling
Title:  for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day's adventures was
Title:  romantic and therefore satisfactory.When the ferryboat with her wild freight
Title:  pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the
Title:  captain of the craft.
Title:  
Title:     Huck was already upon his watch when the ferry-boat's lights went
Title:  glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young people
Title:  were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to
Title:  death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop at the wharf
Title:  -- and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his
Title:  business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten o'clock came, and the
Title:  noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling
Title:  foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its slumbers and
Title:  left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts. Eleven o'clock
Title:  came, and the tavern lights were put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck
Title:  waited what seemed a weary long time, but nothing happened. His faith was
Title:  weakening. Was there any use? Was there really any use? Why not give it up
Title:  and turn in?
Title:  
Title:     A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley
Title:  door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next
Title:  moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under his
Title:  arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure. Why
Title:  call Tom now? It would be absurd -- the
Title:  men would get away with the box and never be found again. No, he would stick
Title:  to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness for security
Title:  from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along
Title:  behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far
Title:  enough ahead not to be invisible.
Title:  
Title:     They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up a
Title:  cross-street. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path
Title:  that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old Welshman's
Title:  house, half-way up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward.
Title:  Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never
Title:  stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the
Title:  narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the
Title:  gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his distance, now, for they would never
Title:  be able to see him. He trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace,
Title:  fearing he was gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether;
Title:  listened; no sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own
Title:  heart. The hooting of an owl came over the hill -- ominous sound! But no
Title:  footsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! He was about to spring with winged
Title:  feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck's heart
Title:  shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there
Title:  shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak
Title:  that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He
Title:  knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas'
Title:  grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won't be hard to
Title:  find.
Title:  
Title:     Now there was a voice -- a very low voice -- Injun Joe's:
Title:  
Title:     "Damn her, maybe she's got company -- there's lights, late as it is."
Title:  
Title:     "I can't see any."
Title:  
Title:     This was that stranger's voice -- the stranger of the haunted house. A
Title:  deadly chill went to Huck's heart -- this, then, was the "revenge" job! His
Title:  thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind
Title:  to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder her. He
Title:  wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn't dare -- they
Title:  might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in the moment that
Title:  elapsed between the stranger's remark and Injun Joe's next -- which was --
Title:  
Title:     "Because the bush is in your way. Now -- this way -- now you see, don't
Title:  you?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes. Well, there is company there, I reckon. Better give it up."
Title:  
Title:     "Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and
Title:  maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've told you before,
Title:  I don't care for her swag -- you may have it. But her husband was rough on me
Title:  -- many times he was rough on me -- and mainly he was the justice of the
Title:  peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain't all. It ain't a millionth
Title:  part of it! He had me horsewhipped! -- horsewhipped in front of the jail,
Title:  like a nigger! -- with all the town looking on! HORSEWHIPPED! -- do you
Title:  understand? He took advantage of me and died. But I'll take it out of her."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!"
Title:  
Title:     "Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill him if he was here;
Title:  but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don't kill her --
Title:  bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils -- you notch her ears like
Title:  a sow!"
Title:  
Title:     "By God, that's -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I'll tie her
Title:  to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I'll not cry, if she
Title:  does. My friend, you'll help me in this thing -- for MY sake -- that's why
Title:  you're here -- I mightn't be able alone. If you flinch, I'll kill you. Do
Title:  you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I'll kill her -- and then I
Title:  reckon nobody'll ever know much about who done this business."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the better --
Title:  I'm all in a shiver."
Title:  
Title:     "Do it now? And company there? Look here -- I'll get suspicious of you,
Title:  first thing you know.  No -- we'll wait till the lights are out -- there's
Title:  no hurry."
Title:  
Title:     Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue -- a thing still more awful
Title:  than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped
Title:  gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,
Title:  one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one side
Title:  and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same elaboration
Title:  and the same risks; then another and another, and -- a twig snapped under
Title:  his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no sound -- the
Title:  stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he turned in his
Title:  tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes -- turned himself as carefully as
Title:  if he were a ship -- and then stepped quickly but cautiously along. When he
Title:  emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so he picked up his nimble heels
Title:  and flew. Down, down he sped, till he reached the Welshman's. He banged at
Title:  the door, and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons
Title:  were thrust from windows.
Title:  
Title:     "What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?"
Title:  
Title:     "Let me in -- quick! I'll tell everything."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, who are you?"
Title:  
Title:     "Huckleberry Finn -- quick, let me in!"
Title:  
Title:     "Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I judge!
Title:  But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble."
Title:  
Title:     "Please don't ever tell I told you," were Huck's first words when he got
Title:  in. "Please don't -- I'd be killed, sure -- but the widow's been good
Title:  friends to me sometimes, and I want to tell -- I will tell if you'll promise
Title:  you won't ever say it was me."
Title:  
Title:     "By George, he has got something to tell, or he wouldn't act so!"
Title:  exclaimed the old man; "out with it and nobody here'll ever tell, lad."
Title:  
Title:     Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the
Title:  hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in their
Title:  hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great bowlder and
Title:  fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and then all of a
Title:  sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.
Title:  
Title:     Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as
Title:  fast as his legs could carry him.
Title:

Title:                                   Chapter XXX
Title:  
Title:     AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came
Title:  groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door. The
Title:  inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on
Title:  account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window:
Title:  
Title:     "Who's there!"
Title:  
Title:     Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:
Title:  
Title:     "Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!"
Title:  
Title:     "It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad! -- and welcome!"
Title:  
Title:     These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the pleasantest
Title:  he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever
Title:  been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he
Title:  entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons
Title:  speedily dressed themselves.
Title:  
Title:     "Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be
Title:  ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too -- make
Title:  yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop here
Title:  last night."
Title:  
Title:     "I was awful scared," said Huck, "and I run. I took out when the pistols
Title:  went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted to
Title:  know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't want to
Title:  run across them devils, even if they was dead."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it -- but
Title:  there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they ain't
Title:  dead, lad -- we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right where to
Title:  put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till
Title:  we got within fifteen feet of them -- dark as a cellar that sumach path was
Title:  -- and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of
Title:  luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use -- 'twas bound to come, and it did
Title:  come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started
Title:  those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung out, 'Fire boys!'
Title:  and blazed away at the place where the rustling was. So did the boys. But
Title:  they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through
Title:  the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they
Title:  started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn't do us any harm. As soon as
Title:  we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred
Title:  up the constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the
Title:  river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to
Title:  beat up the
Title:  woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of
Title:  description of those rascals -- 'twould help a good deal. But you couldn't
Title:  see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh yes; I saw them down-town and follered them."
Title:  
Title:     "Splendid! Describe them -- describe them, my boy!"
Title:  
Title:     "One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or
Title:  twice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged -- "
Title:  
Title:     "That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back
Title:  of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and tell
Title:  the sheriff -- get your breakfast to-morrow morning!"
Title:  
Title:     The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck
Title:  sprang up and exclaimed:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, please don't tell anybody it was me that blowed on them! Oh,
Title:  please!"
Title:  
Title:     "All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what
Title:  you did."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh no, no! Please don't tell!"
Title:  
Title:     When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:
Title:  
Title:     "They won't tell -- and I won't. But why don't you want it known?"
Title:  
Title:     Huck would not explain, further than to say that
Title:  he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man
Title:  know that he knew anything against him for the whole world -- he would be
Title:  killed for knowing it, sure.
Title:  
Title:     The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:
Title:  
Title:     "How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
Title:  suspicious?"
Title:  
Title:     Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot, -- least everybody says so, and
Title:  I don't see nothing agin it -- and sometimes I can't sleep much, on account
Title:  of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing.
Title:  That was the way of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I come along
Title:  up-street 'bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old
Title:  shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to
Title:  have another think. Well, just then along comes these two chaps slipping
Title:  along close by me, with something under their arm, and I reckoned they'd
Title:  stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other one wanted a light; so they stopped
Title:  right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that the big one
Title:  was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white whiskers and the patch on his
Title:  eye, and t'other one was a rusty, ragged-looking devil."
Title:  
Title:     "Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?"
Title:  
Title:     This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I don't know -- but somehow it seems as if I did."
Title:  
Title:     "Then they went on, and you -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Follered 'em -- yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up -- they
Title:  sneaked along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the dark
Title:  and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd
Title:  spile her looks just as I told you and your two -- "
Title:  
Title:     "What! The deaf and dumb man said all that!"
Title:  
Title:     Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep
Title:  the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and
Title:  yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he
Title:  could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old
Title:  man's eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the
Title:  Welshman said:
Title:  
Title:     "My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for
Title:  all the world. No -- I'd protect you -- I'd protect you. This Spaniard is
Title:  not deaf and dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you can't
Title:  cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want to
Title:  keep dark. Now trust me -- tell me what it is, and trust me -- I won't
Title:  betray you."
Title:  
Title:     Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and
Title:  whispered in his ear:
Title:  
Title:     "'Tain't a Spaniard -- it's Injun Joe!"
Title:  
Title:     The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:
Title:  
Title:     "It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and
Title:  slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white
Title:  men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a different matter
Title:  altogether."
Title:  
Title:     During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man
Title:  said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to
Title:  bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks
Title:  of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of --
Title:  
Title:     "Of WHAT?"
Title:  
Title:     If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more
Title:  stunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring wide,
Title:  now, and his breath suspended -- waiting for the answer. The Welshman
Title:  started -- stared in return -- three seconds -- five seconds -- ten -- then
Title:  replied:
Title:  
Title:     "Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the matter with you?"
Title:  
Title:     Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The
Title:  Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously -- and presently said:
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what
Title:  did give you that turn? What were you expecting we'd found?"
Title:  
Title:     Huck was in a close place -- the inquiring eye was upon him -- he would
Title:  have given anything for material for a plausible answer -- nothing suggested
Title:  itself -- the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper -- a senseless
Title:  reply offered -- there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered
Title:  it -- feebly:
Title:  
Title:     "Sunday-school books, maybe."
Title:  
Title:     Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and
Title:  joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended
Title:  by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's pocket, because it cut down
Title:  the doctor's bill like everything. Then he added:
Title:  
Title:     "Poor old chap, you're white and jaded -- you ain't well a bit -- no
Title:  wonder you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out of
Title:  it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope."
Title:  
Title:     Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a
Title:  suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought
Title:  from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the
Title:  widow's stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure, however -- he
Title:  had not known that it wasn't -- and so the suggestion of a captured bundle
Title:  was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole he felt glad the
Title:  little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all question that that
Title:  bundle was not the bundle, and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly
Title:  comfortable.
Title:  In fact, everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction, now;
Title:  the treasure must be still in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed
Title:  that day, and he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble
Title:  or any fear of interruption.
Title:  
Title:     Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck
Title:  jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even remotely
Title:  with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen,
Title:  among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were
Title:  climbing up the hill -- to stare at the stile. So the news had spread. The
Title:  Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors. The widow's
Title:  gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.
Title:  
Title:     "Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more
Title:  beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me to
Title:  tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but for him."
Title:  
Title:     Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the
Title:  main matter -- but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his
Title:  visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused
Title:  to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:
Title:  
Title:     "I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that
Title:  noise. Why didn't you come and wake me?"
Title:  
Title:     "We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come
Title:  again -- they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of
Title:  waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at
Title:  your house all the rest of the night. They've just come back."
Title:  
Title:     More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple
Title:  of hours more.
Title:  
Title:     There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was
Title:  early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came that not a
Title:  sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the sermon was
Title:  finished, Judge Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she
Title:  moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired
Title:  to death."
Title:  
Title:     "Your Becky?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes," with a startled look -- "didn't she stay with you last night?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, no."
Title:  
Title:     Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,
Title:  talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:
Title:  
Title:     "Good-morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good-morning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy
Title:  that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night --
Title:  one of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to settle with
Title:  him."
Title:  
Title:     Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.
Title:  
Title:     "He didn't stay with us," said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A
Title:  marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.
Title:  
Title:     "Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?"
Title:  
Title:     "No'm."
Title:  
Title:     "When did you see him last?"
Title:  
Title:     Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had
Title:  stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness
Title:  took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned,
Title:  and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky
Title:  were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one
Title:  thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One young man finally blurted
Title:  out his fear that they were still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away.
Title:  Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands.
Title:  
Title:     The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to
Title:  street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole
Title:  town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance, the
Title:  burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the
Title:  ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half an hour old, two
Title:  hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave.
Title:  
Title:     All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women
Title:  visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They cried
Title:  with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the tedious night
Title:  the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word
Title:  that came was, "Send more candles -- and send food." Mrs. Thatcher was
Title:  almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope
Title:  and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.
Title:  
Title:     The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle-grease,
Title:  smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck still in the bed that
Title:  had been provided for him, and delirious with fever. The physicians were all
Title:  at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She
Title:  said she would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or
Title:  indifferent, he was the Lord's, and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing
Title:  to be neglected. The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow
Title:  said:
Title:  
Title:     "You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off. He
Title:  never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands."
Title:  
Title:     Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the
Title:  village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the news
Title:  that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern
Title:  were being ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner
Title:  and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered
Title:  through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and
Title:  thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow
Title:  reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the
Title:  section usually traversed by tourists, the names "BECKY & TOM" had been
Title:  found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a
Title:  grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried
Title:  over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child;
Title:  and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this
Title:  one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came. Some
Title:  said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would
Title:  glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go
Title:  trooping down the echoing aisle -- and then a sickening disappointment
Title:  always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's
Title:  light.
Title:  
Title:     Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and the
Title:  village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything. The
Title:  accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the Temperance
Title:  Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse,
Title:  tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the
Title:  subject of taverns, and finally
Title:  asked -- dimly dreading the worst -- if anything had been discovered at the
Title:  Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.
Title:  
Title:     "Yes," said the widow.
Title:  
Title:     Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:
Title:  
Title:     "What? What was it?"
Title:  
Title:     "Liquor! -- and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child -- what a
Title:  turn you did give me!"
Title:  
Title:     "Only tell me just one thing -- only just one -- please! Was it Tom
Title:  Sawyer that found it?"
Title:  
Title:     The widow burst into tears. "Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you
Title:  before, you must not talk. You are very, very sick!"
Title:  
Title:     Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great
Title:  powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever -- gone
Title:  forever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should cry.
Title:  
Title:     These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the
Title:  weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:
Title:  
Title:     "There -- he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody
Title:  could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's got hope
Title:  enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching."

Title:                                  Chapter XXXI
Title:  
Title:     NOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They tripped along
Title:  the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders
Title:  of the cave -- wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names, such as
Title:  "The Drawing-Room," "The Cathedral," "Aladdin's Palace," and so on.
Title:  Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in
Title:  it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they
Title:  wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the
Title:  tangled web-work of names, dates, post-office addresses, and mottoes with
Title:  which the rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting
Title:  along and talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the
Title:  cave whose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an
Title:  overhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a
Title:  little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone
Title:  sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled
Title:  Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body
Title:  behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky's gratification.
Title:  He found that it curtained a sort of
Title:  steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once
Title:  the ambition to be a discoverer seized him. Becky responded to his call, and
Title:  they made a smoke-mark for future guidance, and started upon their quest.
Title:  They wound this way and that, far down into the secret depths of the cave,
Title:  made another mark, and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper
Title:  world about. In one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling
Title:  depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference
Title:  of a man's leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and
Title:  presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it. This
Title:  shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted with
Title:  a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose
Title:  walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the
Title:  joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the
Title:  ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had
Title:  packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the
Title:  creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting
Title:  furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of
Title:  conduct. He seized Becky's hand and hurried her into the first corridor that
Title:  offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky's light out with its wing
Title:  while she was passing
Title:  out of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the
Title:  fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got rid
Title:  of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly, which
Title:  stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows. He
Title:  wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best to sit
Title:  down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep stillness of
Title:  the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. Becky said:
Title:  
Title:     "Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the
Title:  others."
Title:  
Title:     "Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them -- and I don't know
Title:  how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't hear
Title:  them here."
Title:  
Title:     Becky grew apprehensive.
Title:  
Title:     "I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better."
Title:  
Title:     "Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me."
Title:  
Title:     "I reckon I could find it -- but then the bats. If they put our candles
Title:  out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go
Title:  through there."
Title:  
Title:     "Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!" and the girl
Title:  shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.
Title:  
Title:     They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way,
Title:  glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about
Title:  the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an
Title:  examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he
Title:  would say cheerily:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right
Title:  away!"
Title:  
Title:     But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began
Title:  to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of
Title:  finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was "all right," but there
Title:  was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and
Title:  sounded just as if he had said, "All is lost!" Becky clung to his side in an
Title:  anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come.
Title:  At last she said:
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get
Title:  worse and worse off all the time."
Title:  
Title:     "Listen!" said he.
Title:  
Title:     Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were
Title:  conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the empty
Title:  aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple
Title:  of mocking laughter.
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid," said Becky.
Title:  
Title:     "It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know," and he
Title:  shouted again.
Title:  
Title:     The "might" was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so
Title:  confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but there
Title:  was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his
Title:  steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner
Title:  revealed another fearful fact to Becky -- he could not find his way back!
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!"
Title:  
Title:     "Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to
Title:  come back! No -- I can't find the way. It's all mixed up."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this awful
Title:  place! Oh, why did we ever leave the others!"
Title:  
Title:     She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom
Title:  was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He sat
Title:  down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom,
Title:  she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and
Title:  the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck
Title:  up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing
Title:  himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better
Title:  effect. She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and follow
Title:  wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any
Title:  more. For he was no more to blame than she, she said.
Title:  
Title:     So they moved on again -- aimlessly -- simply at random -- all they could
Title:  do was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of
Title:  reviving -- not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its
Title:  nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and
Title:  familiarity with failure.
Title:  
Title:     By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy meant so
Title:  much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again. She
Title:  knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets --
Title:  yet he must economize.
Title:  
Title:     By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay
Title:  attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown
Title:  to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least
Title:  progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and
Title:  shorten its pursuit.
Title:  
Title:     At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.
Title:  Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the
Title:  comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom tried to
Title:  think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown
Title:  threadbare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon
Title:  Becky that she drowsed
Title:  off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and saw
Title:  it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and
Title:  by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflected
Title:  somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered
Title:  away to bygone times and dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings,
Title:  Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh -- but it was stricken dead upon
Title:  her lips, and a groan followed it.
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, how could I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I don't,
Title:  Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again."
Title:  
Title:     "I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find
Title:  the way out."
Title:  
Title:     "We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I
Title:  reckon we are going there."
Title:  
Title:     "Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying."
Title:  
Title:     They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried to
Title:  estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was that it
Title:  seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not be, for
Title:  their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this -- they could not
Title:  tell how long -- Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water
Title:  -- they must find a spring. They found one presently, and Tom said it was
Title:  time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky said
Title:  she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to hear Tom
Title:  dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom fastened his
Title:  candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought was soon busy;
Title:  nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the silence:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, I am so hungry!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom took something out of his pocket.
Title:  
Title:     "Do you remember this?" said he.
Title:  
Title:     Becky almost smiled.
Title:  
Title:     "It's our wedding-cake, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes -- I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got."
Title:  
Title:     "I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grown-up
Title:  people do with wedding-cake -- but it'll be our -- "
Title:  
Title:     She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky ate
Title:  with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was abundance of
Title:  cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky suggested that they
Title:  move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he said:
Title:  
Title:     "Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?"
Title:  
Title:     Becky's face paled, but she thought she could.
Title:  
Title:     "Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink. That
Title:  little piece is our last candle!"
Title:  
Title:     Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort
Title:  her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, Becky?"
Title:  
Title:     "They'll miss us and hunt for us!"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, they will! Certainly they will!"
Title:  
Title:     "Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are."
Title:  
Title:     "When would they miss us, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "When they get back to the boat, I reckon."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, it might be dark then -- would they notice we hadn't come?"
Title:  
Title:     "I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they got
Title:  home."
Title:  
Title:     A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw
Title:  that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night! The
Title:  children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of grief from
Title:  Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also -- that the
Title:  Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that
Title:  Becky was not at Mrs. Harper's.
Title:  
Title:     The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it
Title:  melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone at
Title:  last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of smoke,
Title:  linger at its top a moment, and then -- the horror of utter darkness
Title:  reigned!
Title:  
Title:     How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that
Title:  she was crying in Tom's
Title:  arms, neither could tell. All that they knew was, that after what seemed a
Title:  mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed
Title:  their miseries once more. Tom said it might be Sunday, now -- maybe Monday.
Title:  He tried to get Becky to talk, but her sorrows were too oppressive, all her
Title:  hopes were gone. Tom said that they must have been missed long ago, and no
Title:  doubt the search was going on. He would shout and maybe some one would come.
Title:  He tried it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously
Title:  that he tried it no more.
Title:  
Title:     The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A
Title:  portion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But
Title:  they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted
Title:  desire.
Title:  
Title:     By-and-by Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     " Sh! Did you hear that?"
Title:  
Title:     Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the faintest,
Title:  far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by the hand,
Title:  started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently he listened
Title:  again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little nearer.
Title:  
Title:     "It's them!" said Tom; "they're coming! Come along, Becky -- we're all
Title:  right now!"
Title:  
Title:     The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,
Title:  however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded
Title:  against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three feet
Title:  deep, it might be a hundred -- there was no passing it at any rate. Tom got
Title:  down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No bottom. They must
Title:  stay there and wait until the searchers came. They listened; evidently the
Title:  distant shoutings were growing more distant! a moment or two more and they
Title:  had gone altogether. The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom whooped until he
Title:  was hoarse, but it was of no use. He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age
Title:  of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again.
Title:  
Title:     The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged
Title:  on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed it
Title:  must be Tuesday by this time.
Title:  
Title:     Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It
Title:  would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy
Title:  time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to a
Title:  projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as
Title:  he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a
Title:  "jumping-off place." Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and then as
Title:  far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made
Title:  an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at that moment,
Title:  not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind
Title:  a rock! Tom lifted up a
Title:  glorious shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged
Title:  to -- Injun Joe's! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly
Title:  gratified the next moment, to see the "Spaniard" take to his heels and get
Title:  himself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and
Title:  come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have
Title:  disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom's fright
Title:  weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he had
Title:  strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and nothing
Title:  should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful
Title:  to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he had only shouted
Title:  "for luck."
Title:  
Title:     But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.
Title:  Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes.
Title:  The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed that it must
Title:  be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now, and that the
Title:  search had been given over. He proposed to explore another passage. He felt
Title:  willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But Becky was very weak.
Title:  She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused. She said she
Title:  would wait, now, where she was, and die -- it would not be long. She told
Title:  Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he chose; but she implored him
Title:  to come back every
Title:  little while and speak to her; and she made him promise that when the awful
Title:  time came, he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.
Title:  
Title:     Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show
Title:  of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave; then
Title:  he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages
Title:  on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of
Title:  coming doom.
Title:

Title:  
Title:                                  Chapter XXXII
Title:  
Title:     TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.
Title:  Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public
Title:  prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer
Title:  that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good news came
Title:  from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone
Title:  back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the children could
Title:  never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great part of the time
Title:  delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child, and
Title:  raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time, then lay it wearily down
Title:  again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy, and her
Title:  gray hair had grown almost white. The village went to its rest on Tuesday
Title:  night, sad and forlorn.
Title:  
Title:     Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells,
Title:  and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people, who
Title:  shouted, "Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're found!" Tin pans and
Title:  horns were added
Title:  to the din, the population massed itself and moved toward the river, met the
Title:  children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged
Title:  around it, joined its homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main
Title:  street roaring huzzah after huzzah!
Title:  
Title:     The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the
Title:  greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour a
Title:  procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, seized the
Title:  saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to speak
Title:  but couldn't -- and drifted out raining tears all over the place.
Title:  
Title:     Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It
Title:  would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the
Title:  great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon a
Title:  sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful
Title:  adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed
Title:  with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition;
Title:  how he followed two avenues as far as his kite-line would reach; how he
Title:  followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite-line, and was about to
Title:  turn back when he glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight;
Title:  dropped the line and groped toward it, pushed his head and shoulders through
Title:  a small hole, and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by! And if it had only
Title:  happened to be
Title:  night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have
Title:  explored that passage any more! He told how he went back for Becky and broke
Title:  the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was
Title:  tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described how he
Title:  labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she
Title:  had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he
Title:  pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there
Title:  and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed
Title:  them and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men
Title:  didn't believe the wild tale at first, "because," said they, "you are five
Title:  miles down the river below the valley the cave is in" -- then took them
Title:  aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two or three
Title:  hours after dark and then brought them home.
Title:  
Title:     Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him
Title:  were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind
Title:  them, and informed of the great news.
Title:  
Title:     Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be
Title:  shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were bedridden
Title:  all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and more tired and
Title:  worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday, was down-town
Title:  Friday,
Title:  and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until
Title:  Sunday, and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.
Title:  
Title:     Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could
Title:  not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday. He
Title:  was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his
Title:  adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by to
Title:  see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that
Title:  the "ragged man's" body had eventually been found in the river near the
Title:  ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.
Title:  
Title:     About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to
Title:  visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting talk,
Title:  and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge Thatcher's house
Title:  was on Tom's way, and he stopped to see Becky. The Judge and some friends
Title:  set Tom to talking, and some one asked him ironically if he wouldn't like to
Title:  go to the cave again. Tom said he thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge
Title:  said:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt. But
Title:  we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any more."
Title:  
Title:     "Why?"
Title:  
Title:     "Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler
Title:  iron two weeks ago, and triple-locked -- and I've got the keys."
Title:  
Title:     Tom turned as white as a sheet.
Title:  
Title:     "What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!"
Title:  
Title:     The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.
Title:  
Title:     "Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!"
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                 Chapter XXXIII
Title:  
Title:     WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of men
Title:  were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well filled with
Title:  passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge
Title:  Thatcher.
Title:  
Title:     When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
Title:  the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,
Title:  dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing eyes
Title:  had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer of the
Title:  free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own experience how
Title:  this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt an
Title:  abounding sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to him in a
Title:  degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread
Title:  had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this
Title:  bloody-minded outcast.
Title:  
Title:     Injun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great
Title:  foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with
Title:  tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill
Title:  outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect;
Title:  the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony
Title:  obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam
Title:  had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under
Title:  the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked that place in order to be
Title:  doing something -- in order to pass the weary time -- in order to employ his
Title:  tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle
Title:  stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but
Title:  there were none now. The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He
Title:  had also contrived to catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten,
Title:  leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one
Title:  place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground
Title:  for ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive
Title:  had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone,
Title:  wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell
Title:  once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick -- a
Title:  dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling when
Title:  the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were
Title:  laid when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created
Title:  the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was
Title:  "news." It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things
Title:  shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of
Title:  tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has
Title:  everything a purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five
Title:  thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect's need? and has it
Title:  another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No
Title:  matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out
Title:  the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares
Title:  longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to
Title:  see the wonders of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list
Title:  of the cavern's marvels; even "Aladdin's Palace" cannot rival it.
Title:  
Title:     Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked there
Title:  in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for
Title:  seven miles around; they brought their children, and all sorts of
Title:  provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at
Title:  the funeral as they could have had at the hanging.
Title:  
Title:     This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing -- the petition to
Title:  the governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely signed;
Title:  many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of sappy
Title:  women been appointed to
Title:  go in deep mourning and wail around the governor, and implore him to be a
Title:  merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have
Title:  killed five citizens of the village, but what of that? If he had been Satan
Title:  himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their
Title:  names to a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently
Title:  impaired and leaky water-works.
Title:  
Title:     The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have an
Title:  important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the Welshman
Title:  and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned there was one
Title:  thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted to talk about
Title:  now. Huck's face saddened. He said:
Title:  
Title:     "I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but
Title:  whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben you,
Title:  soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you hadn't got the
Title:  money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and told me even if you
Title:  was mum to everybody else. Tom, something's always told me we'd never get
Title:  holt of that swag."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. You know his tavern was
Title:  all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you was to
Title:  watch there that night?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It
Title:  was that very night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder's."
Title:  
Title:     "You followed him?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes -- but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him,
Title:  and I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn't
Title:  ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all right."
Title:  
Title:     Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only
Title:  heard of the Welshman's part of it before.
Title:  
Title:     "Well," said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, "whoever
Title:  nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon -- anyways it's
Title:  a goner for us, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!"
Title:  
Title:     "What!" Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. "Tom, have you got on
Title:  the track of that money again?"
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, it's in the cave!"
Title:  
Title:     Huck's eyes blazed.
Title:  
Title:     "Say it again, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "The money's in the cave!"
Title:  
Title:     "Tom -- honest injun, now -- is it fun, or earnest?"
Title:  
Title:     "Earnest, Huck -- just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go
Title:  in there with me and help get it out?"
Title:  
Title:     "I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not
Title:  get lost."
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
Title:  world."
Title:  
Title:     "Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's -- "
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll agree
Title:  to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I will, by
Title:  jings."
Title:  
Title:     "All right -- it's a whiz. When do you say?"
Title:  
Title:     "Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?"
Title:  
Title:     "Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,
Title:  now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom -- least I don't think I could."
Title:  
Title:     "It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,
Title:  but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know about.
Title:  Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the skiff down there,
Title:  and I'll pull it back again all by myself. You needn't ever turn your hand
Title:  over."
Title:  
Title:     "Less start right off, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little bag
Title:  or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled things
Title:  they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's the time I wished I had some
Title:  when I was in there before."
Title:  
Title:     A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
Title:  was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles below
Title:  "Cave Hollow," Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the
Title:  cave hollow -- no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see
Title:  that white place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, that's one
Title:  of my marks. We'll get ashore, now."
Title:  
Title:     They landed.
Title:  
Title:     "Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out of
Title:  with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it."
Title:  
Title:     Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly marched
Title:  into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this country.
Title:  You just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to be a robber, but
Title:  I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to run across it was the
Title:  bother. We've got it now, and we'll keep it quiet, only we'll let Joe Harper
Title:  and Ben Rogers in -- because of course there's got to be a Gang, or else
Title:  there wouldn't be any style about it. Tom Sawyer's Gang -- it sounds
Title:  splendid, don't it, Huck?"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, most anybody. Waylay people -- that's mostly the way."
Title:  
Title:     "And kill them?"
Title:  
Title:     "No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom."
Title:  
Title:     "What's a ransom?"
Title:  
Title:     "Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after
Title:  you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's the
Title:  general way. Only you don't kill the women. You shut up the women, but you
Title:  don't kill them. They're always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You
Title:  take their watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk
Title:  polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers -- you'll see that in any
Title:  book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've been in the cave
Title:  a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn't get them to
Title:  leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right around and come back. It's so
Title:  in all the books."
Title:  
Title:     "Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses
Title:  and all that."
Title:  
Title:     By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in
Title:  the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then made
Title:  their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought them to
Title:  the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him. He showed Huck
Title:  the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall, and
Title:  described how he and Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire.
Title:  
Title:     The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and
Title:  gloom of the place oppressed
Title:  their spirits. They went on, and presently entered and followed Tom's other
Title:  corridor until they reached the "jumping-off place." The candles revealed
Title:  the fact that it was not really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill
Title:  twenty or thirty feet high. Tom whispered:
Title:  
Title:     "Now I'll show you something, Huck."
Title:  
Title:     He held his candle aloft and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There -- on
Title:  the big rock over yonder -- done with candle-smoke."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, it's a cross!"
Title:  
Title:     "NOW where's your Number Two? 'Under the cross,' hey? Right yonder'swhere
Title:  I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!"
Title:  
Title:     Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, less git out of here!"
Title:  
Title:     "What! and leave the treasure?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes -- leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain."
Title:  
Title:     "No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he died
Title:  -- away out at the mouth of the cave -- five mile from here."
Title:  
Title:     "No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of
Title:  ghosts, and so do you."
Title:  
Title:     Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind.
Title:  But presently an idea occurred to him --
Title:  
Title:     "Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's ghost
Title:  ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!"
Title:  
Title:     The point was well taken. It had its effect.
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that cross
Title:  is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box."
Title:  
Title:     Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended. Huck
Title:  followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock
Title:  stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result. They found a small
Title:  recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets
Title:  spread down in it; also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the
Title:  well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there was no money-box. The
Title:  lads searched and researched this place, but in vain. Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "He said under the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the
Title:  cross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the
Title:  ground."
Title:  
Title:     They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck
Title:  could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:
Title:  
Title:     "Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on the clay
Title:  about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what's that
Title:  for? I bet you the money is under the rock. I'm going to dig in the clay."
Title:  
Title:     "That ain't no bad notion, Tom!" said Huck with animation.
Title:  
Title:     Tom's "real Barlow" was out at once, and he had not dug four inches
Title:  before he struck wood.
Title:  
Title:     "Hey, Huck! -- you hear that?"
Title:  
Title:     Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and
Title:  removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock. Tom
Title:  got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but
Title:  said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to explore. He
Title:  stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended gradually. He followed
Title:  its winding course, first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels.
Title:  Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and exclaimed:
Title:  
Title:     "My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!"
Title:  
Title:     It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,
Title:  along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two or
Title:  three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish well
Title:  soaked with the water-drip.
Title:  
Title:     "Got it at last!" said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with his
Title:  hand. "My, but we're rich, Tom!"
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but
Title:  we have got it, sure! Say -- let's not fool around here. Let's snake it out.
Title:  Lemme see if I can lift the box."
Title:  
Title:     It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift
Title:  it, after an awkward fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.
Title:  
Title:     "I thought so," he said; "they carried it like it was heavy, that day at
Title:  the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of fetching
Title:  the little bags along."
Title:  
Title:     The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock.
Title:  
Title:     "Now less fetch the guns and things," said Huck.
Title:  
Title:     "No, Huck -- leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we go
Title:  to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our orgies
Title:  there, too. It's an awful snug place for orgies."
Title:  
Title:     "What orgies?"
Title:  
Title:     "I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to have
Title:  them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's getting
Title:  late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we get to the
Title:  skiff."
Title:  
Title:     They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily
Title:  out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff.
Title:  As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way. Tom
Title:  skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck,
Title:  and landed shortly after dark.
Title:  
Title:     "Now, Huck," said Tom, "we'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's
Title:  woodshed, and I'll come
Title:  up in the morning and we'll count it and divide, and then we'll hunt up a
Title:  place out in the woods for it where it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here
Title:  and watch the stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor's little wagon; I won't
Title:  be gone a minute."
Title:  
Title:     He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small
Title:  sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off, dragging
Title:  his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman's house, they
Title:  stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the Welshman stepped
Title:  out and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Hallo, who's that?"
Title:  
Title:     "Huck and Tom Sawyer."
Title:  
Title:     "Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. Here
Title:  -- hurry up, trot ahead -- I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not as
Title:  light as it might be. Got bricks in it? -- or old metal?"
Title:  
Title:     "Old metal," said Tom.
Title:  
Title:     "I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away
Title:  more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than
Title:  they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that's human nature
Title:  -- hurry along, hurry along!"
Title:  
Title:     The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.
Title:  
Title:     "Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'."
Title:  
Title:     Huck said with some apprehension -- for he was long used to being falsely
Title:  accused:
Title:  
Title:     "Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing."
Title:  
Title:     The Welshman laughed.
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you and
Title:  the widow good friends?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway."
Title:  
Title:     "All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?"
Title:  
Title:     This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he
Title:  found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas' drawing-room. Mr.
Title:  Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.
Title:  
Title:     The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence
Title:  in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the
Title:  Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great many
Title:  more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys as heartily
Title:  as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They were covered
Title:  with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation,
Title:  and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the
Title:  two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:
Title:  
Title:     "Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and
Title:  Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry."
Title:  
Title:     "And you did just right," said the widow. "Come with me, boys."
Title:  
Title:     She took them to a bedchamber and said:
Title:  
Title:     "Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes --
Title:  shirts, socks, everything complete. They're Huck's -- no, no thanks, Huck --
Title:  Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both of you. Get into
Title:  them. We'll wait -- come down when you are slicked up enough."
Title:  
Title:     Then she left.
Title:  
Title:    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title:  
Title:                                  Chapter XXXIV
Title:  
Title:     HUCK said: "Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain't
Title:  high from the ground."
Title:  
Title:     "Shucks! what do you want to slope for?"
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I ain't
Title:  going down there, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take care of
Title:  you."
Title:  
Title:     Sid appeared.
Title:  
Title:     "Tom," said he, "auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary
Title:  got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been fretting about you. Say
Title:  -- ain't this grease and clay, on your clothes?"
Title:  
Title:     "Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all this
Title:  blow-out about, anyway?"
Title:  
Title:     "It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time it's
Title:  for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they helped her out
Title:  of the other night. And say -- I can tell you something, if you want to
Title:  know."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, what?"
Title:  
Title:     "Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people
Title:  here to-night, but I overheard him tell auntie to-day about it, as a secret,
Title:  but I reckon it's not much of a secret now. Everybody knows -- the widow,
Title:  too, for all she tries to let on she don't. Mr. Jones was bound Huck should
Title:  be here -- couldn't get along with his grand secret without Huck, you know!"
Title:  
Title:     "Secret about what, Sid?"
Title:  
Title:     "About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones was
Title:  going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop
Title:  pretty flat."
Title:  
Title:     Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.
Title:  
Title:     "Sid, was it you that told?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, never mind who it was. Somebody told -- that's enough."
Title:  
Title:     "Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and
Title:  that's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a' sneaked down the hill
Title:  and never told anybody on the robbers. You can't do any but mean things, and
Title:  you can't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones. There -- no
Title:  thanks, as the widow says" -- and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped him to
Title:  the door with several kicks. "Now go and tell auntie if you dare -- and
Title:  to-morrow you'll catch it!"
Title:  
Title:     Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table, and a
Title:  dozen children were propped up
Title:  at little side-tables in the same room, after the fashion of that country
Title:  and that day. At the proper time Mr. Jones made his little speech, in which
Title:  he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons, but
Title:  said that there was another person whose modesty --
Title:  
Title:     And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's share in the
Title:  adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the surprise
Title:  it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as
Title:  it might have been under happier circumstances. However, the widow made a
Title:  pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many compliments and so much
Title:  gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort
Title:  of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as
Title:  a target for everybody's gaze and everybody's laudations.
Title:  
Title:     The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him
Title:  educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in
Title:  business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come. He said:
Title:  
Title:     "Huck don't need it. Huck's rich."
Title:  
Title:     Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back
Title:  the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But the
Title:  silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:
Title:  
Title:     "Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of it.
Title:  Oh, you needn't smile
Title:  -- I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute."
Title:  
Title:     Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed
Title:  interest -- and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.
Title:  
Title:     "Sid, what ails Tom?" said Aunt Polly. "He -- well, there ain't ever any
Title:  making of that boy out. I never -- "
Title:  
Title:     Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly did
Title:  not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table
Title:  and said:
Title:  
Title:     "There -- what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's
Title:  mine!"
Title:  
Title:     The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for a
Title:  moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said he
Title:  could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of interest.
Title:  There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the charm of its
Title:  flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:
Title:  
Title:     "I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it
Title:  don't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I'm
Title:  willing to allow."
Title:  
Title:     The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand
Title:  dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time before,
Title:  though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that
Title:  in property.

Title:                                  Chapter XXXV
Title:  
Title:     THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall made a
Title:  mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a sum, all
Title:  in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked about, gloated
Title:  over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the
Title:  strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every "haunted" house in St. Petersburg
Title:  and the neighboring villages was dissected, plank by plank, and its
Title:  foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasure -- and not by boys, but
Title:  men -- pretty grave, unromantic men, too, some of them. Wherever Tom and
Title:  Huck appeared they were courted, admired, stared at. The boys were not able
Title:  to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before; but now their
Title:  sayings were treasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to
Title:  be regarded as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and
Title:  saying commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and
Title:  discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper
Title:  published biographical sketches of the boys.
Title:  
Title:     The Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and Judge
Title:  Thatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request. Each lad had an
Title:  income, now, that was simply prodigious -- a dollar for every week-day in
Title:  the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got -- no,
Title:  it was what he was promised -- he generally couldn't collect it. A dollar
Title:  and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old
Title:  simple days -- and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.
Title:  
Title:     Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no
Title:  commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When Becky
Title:  told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her whipping at
Title:  school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded grace for the
Title:  mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her
Title:  shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a
Title:  noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie -- a lie that was worthy to hold up its
Title:  head and march down through history breast to breast with George
Title:  Washington's lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky thought her father had
Title:  never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped
Title:  his foot and said that. She went straight off and told Tom about it.
Title:  
Title:     Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some
Title:  day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the
Title:  National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school in
Title:  the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or both.
Title:  
Title:     Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas'
Title:  protection introduced him into society -- no, dragged him into it, hurled
Title:  him into it -- and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The
Title:  widow's servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they
Title:  bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or
Title:  stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had to eat
Title:  with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate; he had to learn
Title:  his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so properly that speech was
Title:  become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles
Title:  of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.
Title:  
Title:     He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up
Title:  missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great
Title:  distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high and low,
Title:  they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning Tom Sawyer
Title:  wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned
Title:  slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee. Huck had slept
Title:  there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food, and
Title:  was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was unkempt,
Title:  uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him
Title:  picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him out, told
Title:  him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home. Huck's face
Title:  lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He said:
Title:  
Title:     "Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't
Title:  work, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's good to me, and
Title:  friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me get up just at the same
Title:  time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to thunder; she
Title:  won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them blamed clothes that
Title:  just smothers me, Tom; they don't seem to any air git through 'em, somehow;
Title:  and they're so rotten nice that I can't set down, nor lay down, nor roll
Title:  around anywher's; I hain't slid on a cellar-door for -- well, it 'pears to
Title:  be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat -- I hate them ornery
Title:  sermons! I can't ketch a fly in there, I can't chaw. I got to wear shoes all
Title:  Sunday. The widder eats by a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by
Title:  a bell -- everything's so awful reg'lar a body can't stand it."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, everybody does that way, Huck."
Title:  
Title:     "Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I can't stand
Title:  it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy -- I don't take no
Title:  interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing; I got to ask to
Title:  go in a-swimming --
Title:  dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do everything. Well, I'd got to talk so
Title:  nice it wasn't no comfort -- I'd got to go up in the attic and rip out
Title:  awhile, every day, to git a taste in my mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. The
Title:  widder wouldn't let me smoke; she wouldn't let me yell, she wouldn't let me
Title:  gape, nor stretch, nor scratch, before folks -- " [Then with a spasm of
Title:  special irritation and injury] -- "And dad fetch it, she prayed all the
Title:  time! I never see such a woman! I had to shove, Tom -- I just had to. And
Title:  besides, that school's going to open, and I'd a had to go to it -- well, I
Title:  wouldn't stand that, Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain't what it's
Title:  cracked up to be. It's just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and
Title:  a-wishing you was dead all the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this
Title:  bar'l suits me, and I ain't ever going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I
Title:  wouldn't ever got into all this trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money;
Title:  now you just take my sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center
Title:  sometimes -- not many times, becuz I don't give a dern for a thing 'thout
Title:  it's tollable hard to git -- and you go and beg off for me with the widder."
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides if you'll
Title:  try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it."
Title:  
Title:     "Like it! Yes -- the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it long
Title:  enough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in them cussed smothery
Title:  houses
Title:  . I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and I'll stick to 'em,
Title:  too. Blame it all! just as we'd got guns, and a cave, and all just fixed to
Title:  rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all!"
Title:  
Title:     Tom saw his opportunity --
Title:  
Title:     "Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning
Title:  robber."
Title:  
Title:     "No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't let you
Title:  into the gang if you ain't respectable, you know."
Title:  
Title:     Huck's joy was quenched.
Title:  
Title:     "Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?"
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than what a
Title:  pirate is -- as a general thing. In most countries they're awful high up in
Title:  the nobility -- dukes and such."
Title:  
Title:     "Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't shet me
Title:  out, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, would you, Tom?"
Title:  
Title:     "Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I don't want to -- but what would people
Title:  say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in it!'
Title:  They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't."
Title:  
Title:     Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he
Title:  said:
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I
Title:  can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the
Title:  widow to let up on you a little, Huck."
Title:  
Title:     "Will you, Tom -- now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some of
Title:  the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd through
Title:  or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?"
Title:  
Title:     "Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation
Title:  to-night, maybe."
Title:  
Title:     "Have the which?"
Title:  
Title:     "Have the initiation."
Title:  
Title:     "What's that?"
Title:  
Title:     "It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's
Title:  secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and all
Title:  his family that hurts one of the gang."
Title:  
Title:     "That's gay -- that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at midnight,
Title:  in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find -- a ha'nted house is the
Title:  best, but they're all ripped up now."
Title:  
Title:     "Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom."
Title:  
Title:     "Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with
Title:  blood."
Title:  
Title:     "Now, that's something like! Why, it's a
Title:  million times bullier than pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot,
Title:  Tom; and if I git to be a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking
Title:  'bout it, I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet."

Title:  
Title:                                   CONCLUSION
Title:  
Title:     SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a boy, it must
Title:  stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the history
Title:  of a man. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows exactly where
Title:  to stop -- that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of juveniles, he
Title:  must stop where he best can.
Title:  
Title:     Most of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are
Title:  prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the story
Title:  of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out
Title:  to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their
Title:  lives at present.
