Title:  he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel
Title:  he carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the
Title:  he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the
Title:  he could hopefully hail, Ahab's voice was heard.
Title:  he cried:--
Title:  he cries;--aye, he would be a democrat to all above; look, how he
Title:  he did long dissemble; in some sort, did still.  But that thing of
Title:  he gave me to understand that such things did often happen.
Title:  he generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps
Title:  he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing
Title:  he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the
Title:  he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
Title:  he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,
Title:  he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a
Title:  he had never heard there was such a thing as that.  But, perhaps, to
Title:  he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard--a cry and a

Title:  he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
Title:  he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it.  The mincer now stands

Title:  he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last
Title:  he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.
Title:  he once more raised a pistol.
Title:  he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance,
Title:  he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed
Title:  he rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the

Title:  sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a
Title:  sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy
Title:  sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.  Seeing he wasn't

Title:  sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its
Title:  sort.  But I may as well say--en passant, as the French remark--that
Title:  sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off
Title:  sorts which are to follow.
Title:  sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the
Title:  sorts; those composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering
Title:  sought to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the

Title:  soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up
Title:  soul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his
Title:  soul.  A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's
Title:  souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof
Title:  souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise.  But all in
Title:  souls to see.  As the unsetting polar star, which through the
Title:  sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.  Meanwhile the
Title:  sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank.
Title:  sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea;
Title:  sounded like a coffin-tap.  On life and death this old man walked.
Title:  sounded like a cough."
Title:  sounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on
Title:  sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the
Title:  soundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were
Title:  soundings; heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue
Title:  sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress
Title:  sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.  With other men, perhaps, such

Title:  southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at

Title:  spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at first, this sort of
Title:  sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.

Title:  species.

Title:  spectacle.
Title:  spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
Title:  speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded
Title:  speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.
Title:  speechless, placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake
