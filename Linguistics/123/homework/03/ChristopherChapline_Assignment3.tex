\section*{Problem 1}

%As we noted on page 34, it follows that if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, that
%A = B. Explain why this is so. Prove that this is so.

The statement that $A \subseteq B$ implies that every element in $A$ is also contained within $B$. Additionally, the statement
$B \subseteq A$ implies that every element in $B$ is also contained within $A$. If $A$ contains all of the elements in $B$, and
$B$ contains all of the elements in $A$, then it follows (as night follows day), that $A$ and $B$ must contain the same elements.

\section*{Problem 2}

%The empty set is a proper subset of all sets except one. Which one and
%why?

The empty set is not a proper subset of itself. The definition of proper subset requires that the second operand contain elements not
contained within the first operand. This would imply that no set could be a proper subset of itself, because it cannot possibly meet
the requirement for additional elements to be present. This property holds for the empty set as well.

\section*{Problem 3}

%We gave a number of theorems on page 38. Prove these
%1. If A ⊆ B then A ∪ C ⊆ B ∪ C
%2. If A ⊆ B then A ∩ C ⊆ B ∩ C
%3. If A ⊆ B then C − B ⊆ C − A
%4. A ∩ (B − A) = ∅

\begin{theorem}
    If $A \subseteq B$, then $A \bigcup C \subseteq B \bigcup C$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The elements from $C$ getting added to both $A$ and $B$ means that we know that the intersection of $A$ and $B$ contains, at the very least,
    the elements of $C$. Since we already know that $A \subseteq B$, then the addition of the elements from $C$ to both of these sets will mean
    that $B$ contains at least the elements in $C$ and the elements in $A$. Thus, $A \bigcup C \subseteq B \bigcup C$.

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    If $A \subseteq B$, then $A \bigcap C \subseteq B \bigcap C$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    If $A \subseteq B$, then we know that $B$ contains all of the elements in $A$. The intersection $A \bigcap C$ must contain only elements
    elements of $A$. The intersection $B \bigcap C$ must contain any elements in $B$. If any elements are present in $A \bigcap C$, then those
    elements must also be in $B \bigcap C$ because $B$ contains those elements from $A$ since $A \subseteq B$. Thus, $A \bigcap C \subseteq B \bigcap C$.

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    If $A \subseteq B$, then $A - B \subseteq C - A$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    If $A \subseteq B$, then we know that $B$ contains all of the elements in $A$. Thus, the operation $A - B$ will be $\emptyset$ since $B$ contains
    everything in $A$. Since $A - B = \emptyset$, we know that $A - B$ is a subset of every set, since $\emptyset$ is a subset of every set. Thus,
    $A - B \subseteq C - A$.

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    $A \bigcap (B - A) = \emptyset$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The operation $B - A$ will remove all of the elements of $A$ from $B$. Since $B - A$ will contain none of the elements of $A$, then the intersection
    of that set with $A$ will be $\emptyset$ since the intersection of disjoint sets is the emptyset. Thus, $A \bigcap (B - A) = \emptyset$.
\end{proof}
